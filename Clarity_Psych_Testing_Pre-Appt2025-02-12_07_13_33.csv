Most of our medical records will be electronic, encrypted. Any written records including the initial consent forms, letters, outside medical records, will be kept locked. You are entitled to review your medical record at any time, unless we feel that by viewing your records, your emotional or physical well-being will be jeopardized. If you wish to view your records, we recommend that we review them together to minimize any confusion or misinterpretation of medical terms. Time spent collecting, printing, copying, and summarizing the medical record will be charged the appropriate fee. We understand that at times, various forms or letters may be required to assist you with your healthcare needs. Clarity staff can complete forms and write letters as necessary upon request, assuming they do not put the clinician in dual roles or challenge ethical guidelines. Please allow 3-5 business days for completion of requested forms/letters. There may be an additional fee assessed for completion of forms as most insurance carriers do not cover this additional service. Our office is available Monday-Friday 9:00 am - 5:00 pm and may be reached at 617-982-2129 or by email at support@ClarityPsychologicalTesting.com. Our providers are NOT available after hours and some providers may have an alternate working schedule. If you need any further information before your appointment or have questions regarding an appointment, please use our secure portal to message our practice or call during regular business hours.INSURANCE POLICIES – If you did not fill out your health insurance info above, please send a picture of the front and back of your card to support@claritypsychologicaltesting.com or upload to your patient portal (an invitation will be sent after we receive these forms). We are contracted with most insurance companies and have a contracted rate we accept. However, it is your responsibility to verify coverage and deductibles with your insurance company prior to consenting to services. ","Due to the rising costs of our essential test materials and the fact that insurers do not cover these expenses nor provide rate adjustments to offset the continual increases, we are unable to absorb these costs without jeopardizing our ability to continue offering these services in-network. Under the No Surprises Act, we are committed to being transparent about any costs that may not be covered by your insurance.Please be advised that test material fees are considered a non-covered expense by most insurers, including yours. As a result, we must apply a flat fee of $150 to help cover the rising costs of materials essential to your testing and assessment. While the actual costs of materials for a full test battery are significantly higher, we are charging only a small percentage to ensure affordability while maintaining service quality.Upon receipt of the required form, this $150 fee will be assessed. If the payment method on file is valid and the charge is successfully collected, you will be added to our scheduler's contact list to arrange your intake appointment.However, if the payment method on file is invalid or cannot be processed, you will receive one additional reminder to update your payment information and process the charge. If the payment is still not resolved after this reminder, you will not be contacted to schedule your intake appointment until funds are successfully collected. This policy ensures that we can provide continuity of care and avoid unnecessary delays due to payment issues throughout your patient journey.Thank you for your understanding and support in helping us provide quality care while responsibly managing rising costs.","PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING:Overview of Process:Our testing occurs in three easy appointments: 1) the intake appointment where you provide info to the clinician first. Intake appointments can be quick and to the point if there are only a few concerns or they can span a full 45 minutes. 2) the testing appointment (in person) this can be a 4-6 hour day when you come to our office for testing with our psychometrist. 3) the feedback appt.: this is where the clinician goes over the results of your testing with you, what was ruled in, what was ruled out, and treatment recommendations. Around 2 weeks after this appt, the full report will be sent to you via our secure portal. General info: The pre-screening form will be used as initial history. A provider at Clarity will ask for additional information during your initial intake. Please send to support@claritypsychologicaltesting.com or upload any previous neuropsychological test results, school testing results, and/or pertinent records to the patient portal before your initial appointment. We reserve the right to decline a testing case for any reason if we feel it is not a good fit for our practice. At this time, Clarity does not administer the ADOS-2, which is often a requirement of many programs to recognize an Autism diagnosis. However, we are able to screen for Autism in conjunction with testing for other diagnoses such anxiety, depression, ADHD, if you are just questioning it. Misrepresentation:We do not perform evaluations that would be considered falling outside of ""medical necessity,"" as deemed by your insurance carrier. These often include evaluations that are court ordered, forensic, adoption, surrogacy, disability, custody, capacity, competency. You also may be waiving your right to testing by a forensic psychologist (specialist) once you’ve had testing done in our office. We are not specialized or trained to testify in a forensic setting, therefore, this could possibly hinder your chances of winning your case or obtaining disability benefits. You are signing below that if you misrepresent your reasons for wanting testing or are not clear that you are needing testing for reasons outside of pure diagnostic clarification; you will be responsible for the entirety of our fee at the standard rate (not the contracted insurance rate) as well as any travel and/or legal consultation fees incurred as a result of your case. Final Report:Once your full out-of-pocket responsibility has been met, we continue processing your finalized report. Therefore, please make sure your payment is up to date and complete for the quickest turnaround and efficiency of your results. Psychotherapy, or talk-therapy, is a powerful treatment for many mental complaints. It offers benefits of improved interpersonal relationships, stress reduction, and a deeper insight into one’s own life, values, goals, and development. It requires a great deal of motivation, discipline and work on both parties for a therapeutic relationship to be an effective one. Clients will have varying success depending on the severity of their complaints, their capacity for introspection, and their motivation to apply what is learned outside of sessions. Clients should be aware that the process of psychotherapy may bring about unpleasant memories, feelings, and sensations such as guilt, anxiety, anger, or sadness, especially in its initial phases. It is not uncommon for these feelings to have an impact on current relationships you may have. If this occurs, it is very important to address these issues in session. Usually, these unpleasant sensations are short lived. At your initial visit, your provider will conduct a thorough review of your current complaints and of your background. One of the most important curative aspects of a therapeutic relationship is the goodness-of-fit between therapist and client, so, the initial visit is also your opportunity to determine for yourself if the therapist you’ve been matched with is the right provider for you. If you feel that the therapist is not well matched to your needs, we would be happy to provide you referrals to other mental health professionals.Frequency and Durations of Psychotherapy Visits:Your initial consultation visit will decide together the structure of your therapy. If you are to undertake psychotherapy, we find that weekly 45-60-minute sessions will provide the best results. We may discuss an alternate treatment structure depending on your circumstances.","The security of your sensitive information is of utmost importance to us, and we are bound by law to protect your confidentiality. Any disclosure of your treatment to others will require your explicit written consent. As described above, basic information about your treatment may be disclosed to your insurance company for purposes of prior authorization or claims payment if necessary.There are exceptions to this confidentiality, where disclosure is mandatory. These include the following:• If there is a threat to the safety of others, we will be required by law to take protective measures including reporting the threat to the potential victim, notifying police, and seeking hospitalization.• When there is a threat of harm to yourself, we are required to seek immediate hospitalization, and will likely seek the aid of family members or friends to ensure your safety.• If a mental illness prevents you from providing for your own basic needs such as food, water, shelter, we will be required to disclose information to seek hospitalization.These situations rarely occur in an outpatient setting. If they do arise, we will make our best effort to discuss any action plan with you. However, some instances may require action without prior notification. In rare circumstances we may find it helpful to consult with other professionals specialized in such situations (without disclosing your identity). If you are a minor, your parents may be legally entitled to some information about your therapy or testing. We will discuss with you and your parents’ what information is appropriate for them to receive and which issues are more appropriately kept confidential.","Our practice is a teaching facility and as such implements the use of psychometrists, trainees, and graduate level interns who often require supervision and feedback. We employ various technologies to be able to periodically monitor our employee and Independent Contractors (IC’s) performance to ensure quality control and standardization of test administration protocols. In this vein, some or all of your session may be electronically recorded for training and educational purposes. All employees and IC’s of Clarity have signed a Business Associate Agreement, which prohibits them from releasing or sharing any PHI pertaining to our clients with outside parties unless required to by law.","Electronic communications, both telephone and Internet (including email), are not secure methods of communication, and there is some risk that one’s confidentiality could be compromised with their use. Clarity may communicate with clients using these mediums. If you would prefer to not be contacted by telephone, text, or email, please inform us and we will honor this request. For non-urgent matters, please use the patient portal as this is the most secure way of communication. Please allow 24 business hours for a response. Messages left late in the day, on weekends or holidays, may not be returned until the next business day. If you or someone close to you is in crisis or immediate danger, please call 9-1-1 or proceed to the nearest emergency room.","I understand that I am responsible for keeping track of my appointment times and dates. I understand that I am responsible for contacting the practice 48 hours prior to my appointment if I need to cancel or change an appointment for any reason.I understand that although a reminder is sent, ultimately it is my responsibility to know when my appointments are scheduled. If you cancel the same day or do not show up to your appointment then you will be automatically charged a $100.00 fee for telehealth appointments and a $300.00 fee for in person testing appointments. If this fee is not paid or credit card on file is declined your appointment will not be rescheduled.When the office is closed there is a voicemail set up for you to leave a message.If an emergency happens that is outside of your control that prevents you from appearing at your appointment at the scheduled time you can request the fee to be waived.Excessive no shows or cancellations may result in termination of services.

I can not regulate my emotions properly and often have meltdowns that lead to yelling, crying, and harming myself or others. My emotions seem like I feel more than my peers, as I can't handle as much stress or discomfort in things.

At my mom's house, I live with my other younger step brother, my mom, and my step dad.","My parents got divorced when I was around 8. My mom got remarried when I was 14 (I've known my step dad since I was 9/10) and my dad got officially remarried this past June but has been with my step mom since I was 11.","My parents had me and my sister quite young so money was always a little bit of an issue but I never had to go without anything. They were very involved and wanted me to succeed. They always had the best intentions but were occasionally overly emotional, especially my father. I have memories of being screamed at for minor things like spilling my drink or dropping a plate. Mistakes were often not handled with grace. Both of my parents were raised around alcoholic parents. My paternal grandmother would go missing for months on end when my dad and uncle were very young. My maternal grandfather would beat my grandmother so my mom lived with her aunt because it was safer. So while there were little to no diagnosed issues, there are certainly numerous struggles far up my family or origin.","I am very genuine and loyal. I put a lot of effort into everything I do and always want to do the best I can. I make it a priority to be kind and inclusive to everyone because I am very familiar with how it feels to be left out or constantly be a second choice.

I often miss social cues and struggle to talk to people of any age. My interests never quite align with people my age which makes it difficult to make friends. My longest-lasting friendship is about 3 years.","Every romantic relationship I have been in has ended the same way; they say I am so great, compliment me on my personality, and say that it is the healthiest relationship they've ever been in, but they don't have feelings for me anymore. I think this comes from the act that I behave based on a set of rules and expectations which I hold myself to and enjoy doing, but eventually, people recognize this, and then perhaps to them I seem odd and we can't connect emotionally. I think I tend to communicate fully and explicitly but most people don't communicate to the same level I do and I don't understand.","I limit my time on Instagram and TikTok to 1 hour a day because if not I will scroll for hours and it negatively impacts my mental health at times. I can watch multiple hours worth of videos on YouTube a day, but the content I watch is mostly educational. I watch videos about my special interest in small animals/rodents or try to stay in touch with world issues.",No,"Worcester Polytechnic Institute","I have always been an overachiever in school and have in many ways correlated my self-worth with my grades, this has been significantly improved with Zoloft however.

I’m not sure what’s wrong with me. I just know I’m angry all the time and the more people try and make me empathetic the more angry I get. I feel it sometimes but most of the time I don’t feel sorry for people and I think everybody deserves what they get. I want to learn how to get out of this way of thinking I want to know what’s wrong with me and not be so mad all the time I’m pissed off at the world for no reason.

I struggle with social skills like, initiating conversations and small talk with strangers and large groups even when I know everyone individually, and with people I'm comfortable with I struggle with interrupting and talking too much.

She said my Dad got mad once at my brother (before I was born) and he was scary so she told him he couldn't be the mad parent and so she ""compensated"" but she definitely would get angry more often then needed. I never saw my dad angry but he also had a lot of extracurriculars so he wasn't home very often. Also I wasn't home very often because I was at gymnastics or dance practice growing up so I also feel like I got raised from my coaches too.

My parents have been fighting my whole life and I was raised to think I do everything wrong.","Poor social skills - I often avoid anything social because my mind goes blank when I try to maintain any kind of conversation and I panick. I get the worst anxiety about anything in large groups or events so I would rather just avoid them, which makes me stay home a lot, and then I just sit and look at the messes that i cant get myself to clean.","I've had an MRI for passing out, but nothing abnormal found.","Picky eater","It's hard to fall asleep because my brain never shuts off, even though I constantly feel tired. I have to smoke weed before bed and play games on my phone until I am falling asleep sitting up, and then I am able to fall asleep. I do have sertralin to help as well, but when I take it, I feel like it helps me fall asleep but then I wake up sooner than I need to.","books, therapy(which isnt helpful when you are undiagnosed) - books help feeling validated but not much.","Gianna Salvatore - not sure how long - over a year though","I take 300MG XR welbutrin daily. When I dont take it, I notice because I snap easier, but when I do take it, its hard to say what ""normal"" feels like. It definitely rounds out my edges a bit.",No,no,"Weed - I used to ingest Percocet recreationally to help me feel more social, but I have not touched opioids or anything besides weed or prescribed depression meds in over 11 years.","Depression and severe anxiety - currently take 300MG XR welbutrin, and used to be prescribed ativan for ""as needed"" but my new doctor will not prescribe ativan.","ADHD for almost everyone on my moms side, depression, bipolar","I have never been pregnant","I believe so but cannot recall",no,no,"I happily live with my boyfriend of over 9 yeas.","Not lately, but in the past 10 years, my whole dads side of his family passed.My uncle shot himself and I found pieces of him where he did it, my grandpa passed after a long bout of dementia, my aunt died and was found a month after along with her dog. My uncle was found dead in his home from alcohol. Definitely traumatic experiences.","Growing up, I had an older brother and sister that were 10 and 12 years older than me. I grew up similar to an only child because they were already starting there lives. My mother got into a bad car accident and almost died, so my brother and sister started caring for me a lot because my dad was constantly working overnights, and super grumpy when he WAS around. We grew up poor but my parents never made me feel that way because my dad secretly was taking out 100k of credit cards, putting us in massive debt. My mother has an issue where she cares too much of what people think of her, and a lot of my issues stem from her. I remember she never wanted me to have ""rich"" friends, because she wouldnt know what to talk to the parents about since we were poor. Because of that, I grew up thinking I am not good enough for anyone and to this day, I feel the same even though I am aware. My mom refuses to go to therapy or get tested but she has always said she thinks adhd runs strong in our family.","I am extremely empathetic, and while that can sometimes be a weakness, I am proud to be empathetic because you really cannot teach someone that. I am able to see things from all angles, but that can also be a burden when I am constantly questioning everything.","Definitely have the lack of desire to initiate relationships because as previously stated, its really hard for me to relate and my mind goes blank during conversation. My general rule is that if someone talks to me, I'll talk to them, but I'll never initiate. I feel like I am annoying them or bugging them.","Not that I can think of","Instagram and Facebook - I would say I am constantly scrolling even though social media is the worst for my mental health. Its the only way to occupy my brain even though I hate it...",no,n/a,n/a,"It's hard for me to talk about myself - it's much easier for me to answer questions than to come up with it myself. Also I have been trying to get tested for years. Years ago, I had a med doctor that told me she thinks I have ADHD and that its really hard to diagnose women because we hide it well, and then she left the practice and I have felt lost ever since, because she validated how I was feeling and not knowing why. Also, I am hoping I am not charged anything before I find out what I would owe after health insurance - I want to make sure I can afford whatever my part is.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6142334565487035275/6142334565487035275_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6142334565487035275/6142334565487035275_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6142334565487035275/6142334565487035275_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6142334565487035275/6142334565487035275_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6142334565487035275/6142334565487035275_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6142334565487035275/6142334565487035275_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6142334565487035275/6142334565487035275_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6142334565487035275/6142334565487035275_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6142334565487035275/6142334565487035275_base64_75_1738424258.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6142334565487035275/6142334565487035275_base64_76_1738424259.png,No,Kathy,Susol,"Feb 11, 1988","70 Holly Rd",,TAUNTON,MA,02780,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

I do have nightmares, flashbacks, and constant thoughts about it even without triggers.","Some days I spend time in bed all day. Hardly leaving my room. Some days I feel happy then mad and sad in less than a minute or two. I get easily angered. Constantly irritated by even hearing people breathe and talk. There are days where I can be sitting and tears will randomly come out. Sometimes even random shows with small emotional moments cause me to cry easily. Something I never really did before. Sometimes I get paranoid if I locked my door when I left my home and it sticks with me most of the time. Sometimes I feel like everyone is just staring at me and it makes me avoid eye contact. I don’t feel any sympathy for people that I loved so much or in general with people. Others feelings don’t bother me as they are not my own.","As a child I did bust my head open once with a table. I had what I think was a concussion after an ex boyfriend smashed his head into mine with no remorse. Was not able to check as at the time I lived far away from my parents and where my insurance covered.","Bulimia
Binge eating
Purging
Emotional over eating","Always need sleeping medication as I cannot fall asleep without them. My mind constantly raises so it’s hard to fall asleep on my own. Wake up many times during the night. About 4-5 times and then it’s hard to fall asleep again.","Therapy, prescribed medication, church, art. Only thing that helped more than anything was art. Medication only works few weeks to a few months and then loses its effectiveness. Causing meds to be upped in dosage till they can’t go any higher. Then get prescribed other medication and it’s an ongoing cycle.","I’ve seen therapist and psychiatrist since I was at least a 5 year old. Currently 27 and still seeing them. Have seen countless of them over the years.","Have tried Prozac, ability, Wellbutrin and other medication names that I cannot remember due to being on many over the years none caused side effects. All worked for short period of time until the dosage went to the max and then have to be prescribed other medication.","Sometimes I feel like everyone is watching me. I get paranoid about having locked my door or not. Sometimes feel like I am being followed even though I know deep down I am not.",No.,"Started drinking as a teenager. Once I became legal was drinking almost every day for a few months. Took a while to stop. Then I switched to smoking all the time. Smoking 1-3 times a day. When I can’t smoke I drink now. No psychosis at all at any time.","Just severe migraines and headaches. Have to get Botox injections for them because if I don’t I get migraines every day all day or headaches throughout the day.","Mother and brother depressed.
Have no knowledge of other family as I have no contact with any. But I was told my uncle from my maternal side did commit suicide.","Never pregnant.","Was told I walked, sat and spoke at the same time but was not told when exactly it happened.","I do art for a hobby. I do not have anything else currently going for me.","Physical therapists for injuries.","My mother and I live together.","Parents divorced as a child. Moved to different schools as a child due to being in foster care. Moved away from my mother once with an ex for 3 months before returning. Moved was across the map from where I currently lived so it was a huge move to a place where I knew no one except my partner and his close friend.","Father abandoned me at a young age. Would come back a few times over the years before being cut off completely. Felt alone since I was a child because I never felt understand and people tried to avoid me because I was a hyper active child. Mother was always around but hardly touched sensitive topics about health and other things either her. Mother and brother never really hugged me or gave me physical affection growing up and even now. I know nothing of paternal mental health issues besides mother and brother dealing with depressions. Uncle committed suicide before I was born. Family is full of alcoholics though.","Have none. I despise myself.","Have trouble befriending people due to lack of trust. Have lost friendships because my social battery never lets me talk more than a few sentences then I’d disappear for days to weeks before coming back. Have always had drama in relationships because of low self esteem and once again lack of trust. Do not want to initiate any relationship ever again.","First official relationship happened at the age of 21. On and off four about 5 years. Due to my lack of self esteem and desperate need to wanted to be loved by a man because my father abandoned my ex was able to abuse me physically, sexually and mentally. Breaking trust in men altogether. Breaking me in the process by losing myself. Was very dependent on them as well. But over time when I realized I didn’t love them just wanted to be needed and desired was able to finally break off the very toxic relationship. Was abused by a man before my first relationship. Groomed as a child as well and these are all factors that effect relationships and have not been able to have a healthy one the 3 times I’ve tried.","2-3 hours a day. Social media causes lots of emotional stress so I try not to use it unless I am going to post or communicate with a friend.",No.,N/A,"Dropped out of high school. Was able to get HiSET a few years after. When in school had to be put in class for kids who have trouble understand and are rather slow in certain academic classes like science and history. Constantly however was never turning in homework. Constantly skipping. Or being sent to in house 3 days to only skip the day I go back to normal classes. Ending back in house. Becoming a never ending cycle till I eventually passed to 11th grade and then dropped out.","Have dealt with much trauma since I was a child. Had my face get sliced by a window I opened. The glass shattered due to it being an old window. Slicing my cheek to where I needed 32 stitches. Due to this happening on literally my 5th birthday that’s when my self esteem plummeted and I started to hate my appearance. Over times I was groomed by mother’s ex boyfriend and other men in general. Making it hard to have a normal relationship whether friendship or romantic. Put into a mental institute 3 times as a kid. Taken out of home as a teenager and put into foster care due to not going to school. Was put into two foster care homes for a good while each. Had dealt with stalkers as well. Can’t take guys being kind to me because I think they’re just acting good to get me to fall and then they’ll break me like my first abusive ex. Full of lots of self hate but it’s hate that I have had since my father abandoned me and only have gotten worse due to every trauma I had face.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6141935087454299448/6141935087454299448_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6141935087454299448/6141935087454299448_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6141935087454299448/6141935087454299448_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6141935087454299448/6141935087454299448_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6141935087454299448/6141935087454299448_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6141935087454299448/6141935087454299448_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6141935087454299448/6141935087454299448_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6141935087454299448/6141935087454299448_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6141935087454299448/6141935087454299448_base64_75_1738384310.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6141935087454299448/6141935087454299448_base64_76_1738384310.png,Yes,Kiyan,Ali,"Jul 24, 1997","714 Main Street","Apt #402",Worcester,MA,01610,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

hyperactivity
interrupting others
difficulty staying with one train of thought
forgetting multi step instructions","I seem to be totally fine and put together at work, I see my hyperfixation and focus to be a super power in this arena but I feel like I get easily distracted and lose focus in converstaion, processing verbal instructions, and completing tasks in my personal life.","I have a hard time associating the word trauma with myself because I have never experienced physical abuse but I grew up with a parent who had a drinking problem and there were times in my childhood / teenage years when I wasn't sure what version of that parent I would be getting day to day.  This parent has decided that they are autistic and I am taking steps to work towards accepting that they were just emotionally immature / unprepared to be a parent vs being intentionally narcissistic","I feel like even when I am in a good balance of work, fitness, social time, and sleep that I still wake up always tired.  I always power through and am able to go go go once I do but waking up has always been difficult for me.  I would say I've been a shy person since childhood but pushed through so that I could lead a socially acceptable life but I am an only child who feels very comfrotable in my own company but I also desperately crave community but struggle with self-esteem and that I am not worthy of love, friendship, and community.","There was a time in highschool when I seemed to be fainting a lot and we had an MRI but it showed nothing abnormaly and likely was due to not eating enough while being a competitive swimmer.  I faint easily when having blood drawn but also faint when I experience sudden physical pain like hitting my funny bone too hard, etc but can prevent it by sitting or laying down.","Orthorexia (disordered eating under the guise of ""healthy or clean eating""
Binge eating
Over-compensatory exercise","I am trying really hard these days to get 8 hours of sleep but I'd say my average is more like 7 hours of sleep.  I work long days in entertainment ranging from 10-12 hours day and then come home to eat, maybe watch something or read and then go to bed because I wake up around 5:30 to workout prior to work.  I'm finding that going to bed early during the week makes me not able to stay up very late on weekends but I still feel like I look tired even when I get a lot of sleep on weekends.  I do not take anything to fall asleep except recently mixing magnesium and tart cherry juice before bed and listening to the occassional sound bath to fall asleep but once I'm asleep, I stay asleep.","Self help books / podcasts, currently in therapy with LMFT who specialized in adults with ADHD so she helps give me tools and validation but I think I need more help with dealing with childhood trauma and how it affects me currently.  I try to exercise 4-5 times a week with HIIT, Reformer Pilates and Hot Yoga.  I would like to add Bouldering and Hiking back into the mix soon.  Fitness has always been important to me because I worked really hard when I was a competitive swimmer but never felt like I had a body that showed that.  Now I am working to shift my mindset to looking at fitness as a means to keep my body strong and my mind centered and grounded.","2020-2021 - Susan W. Reyes

2023-Present - Risa Williams",No,No,No,No,"I had a partial thyroidectomy in 2014 but I do not take any hormonal medication as my levels continue to be ok.  Otherwise, I take birth control orally.","Yes, my mother struggled with her own depression for most of my childhood and recently has been using the words ""socially awkward"" and ""autism"" to describe herself.","No - never been pregnant","I believe I met them all in a timely manner","Currently I take fitness classes, looking to return to a bouldering gym and hiking group but I don't have any other organized community based activities besides my own interests with my friend groups.","I have had some sessions with a physical therapist regarding a low back injury from swimming in highschool.  I currently do not attend regular PT sessions as Pilates and Yoga are serving me well at the moment to build my core strength.","I currently live alone with my cat.","I work in entertainment so there's been a lot of stress with COVID, the strikes and the prolonged work slow down as fall out from the strikes but I have been very fortunate in maintaining work and have not had much down time.  My mom had breast cancer in 2005, she is healthy and in remission.  My dad was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2009 and is in remission but developed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and began treatment / stem cell replacement in 2021.  He is in remission and ok but it's been hard to see how the cancer and treatment has left him worse for wear and I worry about it.  My beloved grandfather passed in 2018 and my grandma is not doing well at present.","I felt alone a lot growing up in San Jose, CA with my mom and dad but the rest of our extended family was in Florida and Canada so visits were few and far between.  I was bullied in elementary and junior high school.  My home was quiet, I wouldn't say my parent's engaged much with each other.  I knew I was loved and cared for but at times I felt very alone.  When my parents divorced, my mom moved us to a small town in Texas where we knew no one but thankfully it ended up being a nice place to start over but my dad moved to Nevada where he eventaully met his next wife and her children.  I saw him about once a year and we talked often but I always struggled with knowing he had a completely separate life with other people that I was not a part of.  My mom has a lot of childhood trauma with her parents divorce which has and continues to affect her...she seems to live in the past.  I think my dad has a lot of unprocessed trauma as his mom got sick and died when he was a young teenager but he and I have a very engaging and blossomed relationship now.  I have heard stories and theories from family members thinking that my mom was bi-polar and she'll never admit it to me but I think she had a lot of drug use in her youth and then alcohol was prominent in her life during my childhood and teenage years.  She is sober at present to my knowledge but now seems to be resonating with the self diagnosis of being socially awkward and autistic.","I think that I am extremely resiliant (even when I don't want to be) and have a very sensitive heart.  I think being bullied when I was young makes me capable of moving through this world with a lot of compassion for others.","Not dramatic but I am guilty of not always being the person to reach out and really maintain relationships or begin new ones because of fear of rejection.","I loved my last partner so much (and still do) but I ended our relationship because I felt like he couldn't be honest with me about important things like finances but also it was like pulling teeth to get him to open up emotionally to me.  I spent so much of the relationship trying to make sure that he felt safe and loved and then I eventaully felt resentful because I didn't feel it reciprocated.  I still wonder if I made the right choice ending that relationship, it was the hardest thing I've ever done.  I am currently on dating apps and hating every moment of it...I feel rejection (even when it's kind) very deeply.  I try very hard to not fall into codependent patterns due to it being present in my last relationship but my biggest struggle is desperatley wanting to feel chosen by another.  I like the life that I am building for myself but I very much want to spend that with another person and online dating in a modern world is pretty rough on my sensitive little guarded heart.  I also have a very sensitive immune system and get cold sores easily so I've very protective of my physical and sexual health...some people receive that information very well and others do not or I'm not even considered because I move a little slower than most in regards to sleeping with someone.","Instagram - on and off for 1-3 hours a day, maybe?  I don't have a lot of down time at work to be on it but do find myself scrolling if I do have downtime.  I am currently trying to swap scrolling for reading as a night time activity before bed.",No,,"Bachelor's Degree with a focus in Technical Theater","I am not sure I am interested in pursuing medication at present because I am afraid of the unknown.

Then taken from my moms custody, eventually living with my godparents and there kids until ~5.

My paternal half brother (who I refer to as my dad) adopted me and brought me to the US when I was of school age. 

He was remarkably abusive both physically and verbally when irate. His anger issues extended beyond the household, once losing a job due to striking a colleague. 

At home it was not unusual to be beaten with belts, fists, rods, etc. as punishment for undesirable behavior. My home life can best be characterized as ""living with a live bomb"". A neighbor called CPS, resulting in a counselor making a house visit. No further intervention was taken. He was overly present at school, regularly checking in with teachers on a weekly basis. A common threat often repeated by him when meeting my teachers was, ""if I get any comments of bad behavior I may be going to prison, but you're going to the hospital.""  The physical abuse continued until I left his home at 18. When I was 22 I returned to his home, and we had a confrontation, and that was the last time he struck me. 

He filed for disability on the basis of depression when he was ~44. He got divorced from his wife when I was ~ 8yrs old, and does not maintain a relationship with his biological child.

I've always had cultural identity issues not feeling like am Dominican or American enough. I've tried connecting with broader family over the years but have never felt like I belong with them.

These are assignments that are manageable for him, but he seems to have trouble with the fact that he has to do them. He will sometimes kick the teacher's desk and leave the room without permission. He has seen the school counselor and has even mentioned self harm as a way to get out of completing assignments that annoy him.","Edward does have night terrors occasionally. This occurs less now that we strictly monitor his YouTube content. He would get nightmares after watching scary shows.
I do not know of any trauma he has experienced, but he does seem to have a fear of abandonment. I think it is based on the possibility of this happening vs reality. He did fall and hit his head when in preschool. That did seem to be traumatic--he didn't like going to the doctor to get stiches.
It could be that he has experienced something we (my husband and I) are not aware of, or that he was more traumatized from his fall or something else than we realized.","Edward will occasionally have tantrums when things don't go his way. He is really upset when things don't occur the way he wants them to. For example, he was really upset when he left a school notebook at home and when he couldn't find a certain shirt before a basketball game. He was also upset during school, to the point where he talked of self  harm and stayed with the school therapist all day because I was later coming home one evening. 
He experiences a lot of anxiety before going to school. This mostly occurs the evening before. He will curl into a ball and sometimes try to sleep on the floor.
He is contrite after his tantrums and will be honest about his behavior. He is a very kind and thoughtful boy.","He fell and hit his head when he was in preschool.  We took him to the children's emergency to get stiches and he was very upset. It hurt him when they cleaned the wound and he was scared. He threw items around while the staff tried to help him. After he got hos stitches(stables), he was calmer but still upset.","Picky eater","Edward has a lot of trouble falling asleep. He says that his brain is always thinking.","Edward sees a therapist regularly. He will occasionally do yoga with me and I encourage that. We have him play basketball for exercise and so he can make friends. That seems to be helpful, but he will still have episodes where he struggles.","His therapist is Sara at Mindful Solutions in Foxboro. He has been seeing her for about half a year.","Edward is not on any medication.","I do not think Edward experiences any of these things.","Edward has mentioned self-harm and suicidal ideation. This occurs when he is frustrated or anxious. He has not made any attempts to harm himself and has said that he is afraid of getting hurt.",no,"He has not.","I (his mother) have had some issues with anxiety and depression. I do not know of any other cases in his family.
His older brother has high functioning autism and anxiety disorder.","Edward was delivered by emergency c-section due to a dropping heart rate. He was very healthy after delivery, with no signs of any issues (loss of O2 etc)","He met all developmental milestones on time. He talked early, but he still has trouble enunciating certain words properly.","Edward plays basketball. He greatly enjoys STEM and building activities.","Not yet, but we are evaluating if this would be helpful for him.","Edward lives with his family which includes his older brother, his mom (me), and his dad.","My uncle and aunt recently died, but Edward was not close to them as they live in a different state. I think he was sympathetic towards me though even though he didn't know them very well.","Edward's dad was a refugee from former Yugoslavia. Things were very volatile due  to the war.  This makes it harder to be sure about mental health records etc. This occurred long before we met and had Edward, but may be a factor. My family is from Appalachia and so I dealt with a lot of poverty growing up. Many of my family members struggled with alcoholism, but fortunately not my nuclear family.
We try to create a warm, safe environment for Edward and our other son. We are fortunate that we do not need to worry about financial security and can provide a stable household for them.","Edward is very smart and creative. He has a lot of ideas for inventions and wants very badly to be an engineer/scientist. He is very loving and honest. He cares deeply for his family, especially his brother and friends and will often go out of his way to help others.","I'm not sure. He does sometimes seem to create drama in his relationships, particularly if he gets offended by something.","Edward is not dating yet.","Edward watches youtube and plays roblox. We try to limit it to 2 hours a day, but sometimes he will have more on the weekend.","No, but his school will be evaluating him for services.

occupational or relational impairment","I am currently a PA student who has been failing all of my end of rotation exams, but have had this issue all throughout didactic year as well. This isn't just a current problem, but has ben happening all of my life, but I was raised by a family who did not believe in advocating for mental health. I need this urgently in order to not fail out my program, and now I am also anxious and starting to become more depressed because this is my dream, and I fear that I won't be able to accomplish it. I have also been having trouble during my rotations with retrieving information from my brain in order to recite it back to the preceptors. Sitting down for long periods of time in order to document and write notes has also been a struggle. Trying to create and maintain friendships and relationships have also been difficult due to my inconsistent speech patterns, which they have told me ""it is so hard to keep up with you and understand you.""","I have had some sexual coercion in a relationship that I was in, but it does not currently have an effect on my day to day.","I have been losing interest in my studies and usual activities due to my frustration of not being able to complete the exams on time and am afraid to fail out of the program. My ADHD presentation has become more and more severe where it has led me to have poor social skills as well.","For head injuries, I did fall once in my teen years off the trunk of the car and hit my head on the floor and I did have some bleeding, but I did not go to the hospital. I am not aware if I have ever had a concussion. I have been told to do an MRI for my chronic migraines, but I have not gotten the chance to do so.",,"I have difficulty falling and staying asleep. I have tried melatonin, which was unsuccessful. I have had more success with indica strains of marijuana, which has aided in falling and staying asleep, but the last time I used marijuana was on 12/30/2024.","I have tried therapy (childhood/teen years and she said that I do have signs of ADHD, but my parents didn't believe it, so we never pursued further help).","I am currently seeing Theresa Kafiina (psychiatry) and Taylor Verville (therapy) through Dana Behavioral Health. I started to see both since 11/25/2024.","I have not tried any psychotropic medications.","I have presented with any of these.","I do have a history of self-harm and suicidal ideation, but the last time that I self-harmed was in May 2017, and the last time I had suicidal ideation was in 2016. I no longer have these feelings or urges.","The only substance that I have used has been marijuana, for which I have a Medical Card that was prescribed to me for insomnia and migraines, which has helped me fall and stay asleep, and if I am at home and know that I am about to get a migraine, I will also use the marijuana in order to prophylaxis, which has been successful.","The therapist that I was seeing in my younger years did diagnose me with ADHD, MDD, GAD, and OCPD, but I never got further help from a psychiatrist and was never put on any medication because my parents didn't believe in advocating for mental health as they thought I was ""just being a hyperactive kid.""","Father: MDD, ADHD, Dyslexia
Mother: GAD, MDD, OCPD
Sister: Bipolar Disorder with mania, BPD, OCD, MDD, and GAD","I do recall that I was born prematurely at less than 8 months, but I don’t recall other issues other than a prolonged labor and my mother had to have an episiotomy.","I believe so, yes.","Unfortunately, I have not been able to participate in any extracurricular activities at the moment since I am a full-time student. I do enjoy playing volleyball though, and really want to start going to the gym starting this year.","I have not.","Currently, I live in a studio apartment and have a cat.","I did lose an uncle in November of 2023 to cancer.","My parents definitely seemed to have their own mental health issues and did not know how to handle or advocate for them.","Empathetic.
Highly curious and motivated to learn new skills.
Persistent despite challenges.","I find it difficult to maintain friendships due to being very hyperactive and not able to stay on one track, making it difficult for friends to keep track of what I am saying and therefore not have an enjoyable time.","Similar to friendship difficulties, my ADHD presentation has worsened, and now I am even having difficulty getting to a second date because I am very scatter-brained.","1-2 hours on Facebook and Youtube, but more if it is for school-related purposes.","I have an End of Rotation exam at the end of each rotation which is about 4 weeks long.","Northeastern University, clinical/last year","Teacher concerns du to my lack of passing grades; they have mentioned that my knowledge is there, but I am not able to complete the exam in its entirety as I run out of time or miss important details due to trying to rush, especially when the time is starting to run out.","My main goal is to be managed for my ADHD presentation since it has affected my education greatly, therefore it has taken a toll on my mental health. Whether that be test-taking accommodations or medication management, or both. I have reached a point where I have taken it upon my own hands to advocate for myself, my mental health, and any cognitive impairment I may have.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6133831338183049779/6133831338183049779_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6133831338183049779/6133831338183049779_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6133831338183049779/6133831338183049779_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6133831338183049779/6133831338183049779_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6133831338183049779/6133831338183049779_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6133831338183049779/6133831338183049779_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6133831338183049779/6133831338183049779_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6133831338183049779/6133831338183049779_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6133831338183049779/6133831338183049779_base64_75_1737573935.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6133831338183049779/6133831338183049779_base64_76_1737573935.png,Yes,Nayonni,Moreira,"Nov 10, 1997","13 Shetland St","Unit 215",Roxbury,MA,02119,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

This can be something as simple as choosing a workout for the day and becoming so overwhelmed with the options that I do not get out of bed and do not work out. But other days, I have so much motivation, get up, create plans and do multiple workouts etc.

I also recently have been excessively tearful and feel like I could cry over absolutely anything from being overwhelmed. I go down a rabbit hole, with my thoughts jumping from one place to other, rarely ever being positive, and this really kick starts my anxiety, which then makes me irritable.","I have had a concussion as a child from gymnastics and have had MRI's preformed because of migraines.",,"I always try to get 8 hours of sleep.

He also mentioned that he is more than willing to speak to anyone from the office.","I have tried prozac but did not like the way that it made me feel.

When I tried to break up with him he threatened to kill himself. 

My parents also are not the best example of a healthy relationship. They have been together since high school but are now essentially two different people with different lives living under the same roof.

interrupting others
difficulty staying with one train of thought
difficulty completing tasks","I have been applying to grad school and one of the requirements to enter is the GRE. I believe I have always have trouble with standardized testing because of the time constraints and my ability with reading comprehension under pressure and a time constraint. Additionally, even if I know the subject matter outside of the testing environment, I sometimes write down wrong numbers.","I don't think I have any history of trauma that I have experienced.","There are some instances that I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning to get my day started even if I have my day planned out. Sometimes I do become a little isolated and that makes me feel a little depressed so I have to make sure that I continuously hangout with people to make sure that I don't feel lonely.

Sometimes I have a difficult time changing the topic in a conversation after discussing something difficult. Once we have established that the conversation has concluded I sometimes bring it up soon after.","I've had MRI's performed before, but I have never had any head injuries.",,"I sometimes have trouble sleeping. There are times that I get tired, and then I feel like I get a second wind where I cannot quite fall asleep for some time. There have been days where I cannot fall asleep until 3-4am in the morning. Days that I exercise are easier to go to sleep, but I still sometimes may stay up. I have to watch something that is stimulating but still boring enough that will allow me to go sleep.","I started to go to therapy thinking that I had testing anxiety, but I ended up discovering that I have ADHD. I was recommended to do a ""Self Journal"" where I can map out my day. This is a tool that has been recommended to some ADHD people. I have tried meditation and exercise. I sometimes use melatonin when I know I need to go to sleep for an important day. This doesn't happen all the time. I little more of a rare occurrence.","I am currently seeing a therapist and aa psychiatrist. My therapist is called Ruth Pierich and my Psychiatrist is called Jacob Moussai.","Yes, I have been prescribed to take Adderall. I was taking the 20mg XR. This was what I was using to focus during the day. When I was taking it initially, I was having heart palpitations but this went away after around 2-3 weeks. Sometimes these medications make me lose my appetite.","No issues like this.","No, I have never had any of these with or without medication. I have only taken Adderall so I don't think that is a symptom that is common with that one.","I have not had any issues with recreational drugs.","I have been tested to day that I have ADHD.","I think my father has ADHD and depression. My mother has been on anti-anxiety in the past.",N/A,"Yes, I don't think I have had any issues with these milestones.","I socialize with friends a good amount. I was recently applying to grad school so I did not have as much involvement in sports or volunteering as I have normally had before. I would like to be involved in more community groups but I have not been involved.","No, I only recently did a regular therapist.","I am currently living with my partner.","When I was living at home, my father had become injured at work by falling and herniating two of his spinal discs. I ended up moving out of my home and in with my partner.  Was stressed when I loved with my parents because my father became unemployed, my mother had to work and there was a feeling that my nuclear family had fallen into disarray, which caused a feeling of helplessness and overall sadness when I think about my nuclear family.","I am the child of Mexican immigrants. After 2008, my parents were affected by the great recession and lost their jobs and business. My parents ended up making us move to Mexico to cut cost of living. The situation in which we moved to Mexico felt very tumultuous. The reason we ended up moving back to the United States was because my youngest brother suffered a head injury and my parents wanted to ensure that he could get American health treatment. Ever since we moved back to the US, we generally lived in poverty.

My mother was involved in my life. My dad was always away working long hours.  My mother had a pretty abusive mother and upbringing, her father wasn't in her life. I realized she has suffered from anxiety and it has prevented her from wanting to advance in career and education because she has never felt capable of amounting to anything. My father also seems to have had depression and ADHD, which would cause him executive dysfunction and prevent him from making decisions that would have benefitted our family until it was too late. 

My family hasn't dealt with drug abuse or suicide.","I am pretty motivated when I want things. I would say that the only reason that I have been able to succeed in achieving the goals that I've wanted to reach was through diligence and hard work. I sometimes feel like I have to put in twice as much effort as the average person. But trying to be smart about how I work and changing my approaches has kept me able to reach certain goals. I know putting in the effort will make it less difficult to reach goals. I would also say I'm empathetic and try to help others when I need help.","I would say I am pretty friendly. But there are moment when some friends that I don't consider my closest try to hang out and I procrastinate a bit of an amount when scheduling hangouts. I would say that sometimes I have volatility and drama with my family. I would say that they cause it and I just reach or try not to. 

I would say that I am pretty good at being nice to new people in my life and getting along pretty well with those that are currently my friends.","I am currently having issues with my personal relationship with my partner. We are in the process of trying to access couples therapy try to deal with the differences in opinion that we have in our relationship. We seem to be at odds with what we want to get out of our relationship. I am have issues engaging with my partner with intimacy and sex. To some extent I would like to understand if there is any codependence. I do feel like I have emotional deregulation when I feel like my partner is attacking me or treating me unjustly without justification.","I am on social media for the most part of the day. Sometimes I feel like I need to  be listening to the new to finish doing tasks around the house or sometimes when I work during the day. Having something on in the background almost feels necessary when I am trying to do my tasks.","I am not having any psychological tests anywhere else. I am potentially preparing to retake standardized tests for educational (graduate school) purposes. But I do not think that this apply at the moment.",N/A,"I have finished my bachelor and I am preparing to start my masters degree in the fall. I am concerned that my attention span may not be enough during the testing portion of it. I am slower during tests and under pressure and I want to make sure that I am able to perform when regardless of the rigor of all my classes. I want to make sure that the inattentive/ attention deficit issues are not a significant obstacle during my program.","I am mainly coming here to get better insight about my particular ADHD diagnosis. I was trying to get accommodation for my standardized test so I can get more time and have the record of my neuropsychological test. I don't want the lack of accommodations to be an issue for me especially as I get closer to being in grad school again. A lot of the lack of accommodations that I have been getting are because I have not established a history of accommodation in the past.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6131723769425675086/6131723769425675086_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6131723769425675086/6131723769425675086_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6131723769425675086/6131723769425675086_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6131723769425675086/6131723769425675086_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6131723769425675086/6131723769425675086_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6131723769425675086/6131723769425675086_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6131723769425675086/6131723769425675086_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6131723769425675086/6131723769425675086_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6131723769425675086/6131723769425675086_base64_75_1737363178.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6131723769425675086/6131723769425675086_base64_76_1737363178.png,No,Richard,Melendez,"Sep 13, 1995","11819 Kiowa Ave. Apt 210",,"Los Angeles",CA,90049,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

difficulty completing tasks

rumnation, forgetfullnes, difficulty focusing on people when they're speaking, difficulty keeping my attention on things like movies or making myself stop to watch/read","I have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder but have grown concerned that I may have undiagnosed ADHD which could be causing the anxiety and occasional depression.","My mother, who is a recovering alcoholic, once picked me up by my shirt and screamed at me. Witness to lots of verbal fighting in the house as a child.","I can be irritable, especially if there are a lot of tasks to complete or if I fall off track. Some days it is difficult to get out of bed, and it has been since new years. Excessive, obsessive rumination about a variety of situations. Lots of worry. Difficulty trusting that I can handle situations.","I believe I had one undiagnosed concussion as an early teenager.","Binge eating
Emotional over eating","I tend to avoid going to bed as long as I can, especially if I'm nervous about the next day. Lately I've just been staying up late anyway as I just don't want to go to sleep. I don't require anything to go to sleep, although perhaps it could help.","Talk therapy, buspirone, hydroxyzine, exercise. 

The buspar worked for a time but my anxiety has increased again. I would rather not increase my dosage yet again but it may be imminent. It also doesn't address the issues I think could be associated with ADHD. Exercise has helped with my anxiety and I try to stick to a schedule but as of late that has been difficult.","I have seen a therapist at various points throughout my life. Unfortunately, I recently had to stop therapy because of work conflicts.","I take propanolol as needed for public speaking and social situations. It feels like it slows me down too much for social situations but I still find it effective for public speaking.",No,No,"I sometimes drink to relieve anxiety. I have used it in the past to help with social anxiety.","No / None","Anxiety on my paternal side. Significant substance abuse issues on my maternal side.",n/a,"Yes I believe I did. I think I was early to talk, possibly to walk as well.","I attend toastmasters when I can. I run, work out and occassionally do yoga.","I've worked with a physical therapist.","I live with my girlfriend of 8 years.","The biggest change was moving to LA in 2023.","My mother was an alcoholic. I recall significant arguments over her and my father over this, as well as small parties when he was out of town. She got sober when I was seven. I think I largely spent time alone as a kid - watching movies, playing games, exploring my imagination. I know my father has dealt with anxiety in the past and I believe to a degree still does.","I'm smart, kind, driven, artistic, funny (when comfortable), well-spoken (when comfortable), affable.","I have difficulty making friends and forging deeper connections. I tend to not have much drama in my relationships.","None that I can think of.","Way too much time on instagram and reddit. Maybe 3-4 hours total.","No upcoming or prior tests.",n/a,"I have a Bachelor's degree. But I was a terrible student in high school, despite being marked as intelligent. I had trouble focusing on anything that didn't interest me. As such, I only really put effort into my television classes and occasionally english class if I enjoyed the book. I always saw this as stubbornness and I think the adults in my life did as well but I'm less sure about that now. I also got in a pretty good amount of trouble as a teen.","I am finding it incredibly difficult to focus on this questionnaire as I rush to get to other tasks in my day. I'm also having difficulty re-reading and making sure my questions are well-thought out or well-written. I'm not saying this as an indictment of this questionnaire but as an example of something I struggle with.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6123645244412616582/6123645244412616582_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6123645244412616582/6123645244412616582_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6123645244412616582/6123645244412616582_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6123645244412616582/6123645244412616582_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6123645244412616582/6123645244412616582_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6123645244412616582/6123645244412616582_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6123645244412616582/6123645244412616582_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6123645244412616582/6123645244412616582_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6123645244412616582/6123645244412616582_base64_75_1736555325.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6123645244412616582/6123645244412616582_base64_76_1736555326.png,No,Zachary,Weiss,"May 11, 1988","5220 Colfax Ave",,"North Hollywood",California,91601,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

I started on Zoloft in December, and I am on 200mg. Wellbutrin was 150mg. Wellbutrin I found activated me a bit and may have made my OCD slightly worse, but helped slightly with my depression. Zoloft I only started about four weeks ago, but it so far seems to be calming my anxiety a little bit and lifting my depression a little bit.","I experience something like paranoia and ideas of reference that I feel are connected to my OCD and high level of emotional sensitivity.

I have basically broken off communication with my partner due to stress around our relationship.","My parents got divorced when I was 8 years old, and I spent the next 10 years of my life in a split-living situation where I lived with one parent for 3 days, then the other for 4 days, then the first for 4 days, the other for 3 days, etc. This was emotionally traumatic for me as a highly sensitive person, as I spent my entire life feeling afraid of being ripped away from my mom's house (where I felt happy) and going to my dad's house (where I felt unhappy, in part due to my dad's anger issues/emotional volatility). My dad and paternal grandmother are/were both highly anxious people, and my paternal great grandmothers both had severe anxiety/mental health struggles (they were both refugees of mass violence in Europe in the mid 1900s). One of my paternal great great grandfathers committed suicide.","I am a sensitive and thoughtful person who experiences great empathy in certain situations for other beings. I became a vegetarian when I was 4 years old, by my own choice, because I did not want to associate myself with the killing of animals. I am very smart and eloquent, and academically successful. I am also capable of being highly charismatic. I have great natural athletic ability.","Yes, since I came out of chemotherapy I have felt very uninterested in pursuing social relationships/maintaining my prior friendships. I tend to experience volatility and drama in my relationships, because of how sensitive/reactive I am to perceived attacks, slights, and boundary violations.","I have major romantic/sexual trust issues in part stemming from traumatic experiences.

In High School I sustained several Concussions playing football. I don't recall being seen by a doctor for any of them.",,"Not optimal. It's been worse. I used to take Melatonin, but stopped due to reading about dangers of continous use. I've taken myself out of a bad occupational setting and that helped immenseley. I take CBD when needed, and hard to stay asleep but had been useful with a baby. Sex helps.","THeraphy (CBT, EMDR), excersise (Running) and supplements (magnesium) helped with my anxiety and depression. Something else is up.","I am currently not seeing a therapist but have seen plenty in the past, for years at a time.  In the past I have seen psychiatrist concurrently with theraphy, but at the moment I am just seeing a psychiatrist.  My current psychiatrist is Dr. Geoffrey Okoth Odhiambo. He recommended your services. I've seen Dr. Thomas Rodriguez and a Dr. from Kaiser Permanente that I can't recall at the moment.","I took Prozac and helped with mood but caused sexual dysfunction.
I took Wellbutrin  and helped get me functional with tasks but did not help with mood and caused sexual dysfunction to a lesser degree.
I took Buspirone and helped with anxiety but it made me foggy for half my day.

I've taken the aforementioned medications, but nothing at the moment.","Not that I know of.",n/a,"hmm. I would soil my underwear now and again until I was probably 8. I would hate going to the restroom and disrupt what I was doing so I would hold it and hold it until I had an accident.","I was an avid trail runner. I'm currently rehabbing a knee injury and just do the gym. I am lucky to have a few circle of friends I travel and hang out with. My 3 year old is my life at the moment.","Yes.  I had a lisp as a child and was helped by a speech therapist. I've had multiple injuries that have required physical therepist (knees, back, wrist, forearm)","I live with my spouse and 3 year old child in a duplex rental. My parents own the property so its been a help, having them close by. I have an older brother, who is a union Organizer with the Teamsters and younger sister who is a supervising therapist on the UCLA campus. My only surviving grandparent is 101 years old and in a convalescent home nearby.","Yes. I was assaulted, harassed and fired from a job I was successful in, 4 years ago. A lawsuit was settled a bit more than a year ago. I started law school 3 years ago but was only able to complete 1.5 years of school. I had trouble with testing for the Baby BAr and could not pass it. We where forced out of our house of 9 years a little more than 3 years ago; the landlord contaminated our home with asbestos while making repairs we forced him to make through the city rent board ordinance. My spouse was pregnant and we had to move out abruptly, while she was 8 months  pregnant. My dog of 9 years who ran trails with me finally had to be put to death, last year in 2023 after 2 years of battling skin and blood vessel cancer. My baby born on 12.28.21 was the only bright spot in the last 5 years, if stressful. At least she's brought joy as well.","THere was alot of alienation growing up. I was born into a Jehovah's Witness family and it was always at odds with our surrounding mexican community. I felt alone a lot.  Mom came from a family of 18 kids who lived in the Durango Mexico forests, like homesteaders so I'm sure there's something there. Could not play with the street kids. Parents where not involved if dutiful with fufllling basic necessities. Always had a meal, a home, a bed, clothes. Doing well in school did not seem to matter. Nobody checked my homework but definitely made sure I did my Bible studies. Learned scholarship from home and faith but not school. I barely graduated with a 2.0 from High School. Never had a 1st period in 4 years of high school. I passed AP testing in 8th grade for Spanish language and received 2 years of high school credit. Nobody noticed. I took 2 years of community college and transferred to UC Berkeley. I was outclassed and struggled. Should have been class of 2006 I returned in 2016 to finish my degree. Think that perhaps my father and brother have ADHD, as well. We all struggle with writing but thought of as smart by others. Anger is a cornerstone of their personalities but begining to think its just a coping mechanism. I remember being told by my brother to embrace your anger cuz it helps you focus. I did that for a long time too, but as a tool and never sat well with me as a personality trait. It's draiining and not sustainable. My father only went to the 1st grade and did not learn how to read until an adult. Jehovah' Witness taught him in the states. He immigrated as a 15 year old from Sinaloa Mexico.","Tenacity- I don't give up, I'll keep at something because I hate failing.
Love- I care about others and care for them.
Breadth of Knowledge- I know a lot of disparate information and can combine it novely sometimes.
Sense of humor- I have a dry wit and dark humor that people appreciate. 
Perceptive- I can understand my surroundings and people really well. Know how to navigate around dangerous environments and people.
Courage-I get scared alot but adroit at facing my fears.
Public Speaking Skills on point in Spanish and English","It depends. my main circle of friends are from childhood so I think they have been more forgiving, especially when I used to ape my older brothers behaviour thinking  it was the way to be. 

At Cal, I was involved in student organizing and was voted by a peer group to be ""most likeley to scandalize a meeting"". I have felt compelled to speak up but it has been a life long learning process in being tactful. I only keep in contact with one friend from my Cal days.

My struggle is not understanding how having differences, even if sincere, can lead to bad and unintended consequences to my own detriment;unforced errors.

IN my work life, as a union Organizer, I've accomplished alot but I have to realize that something is wrong when my accomplishments stand out in my resume but I'm unemployed. Labor is filled with lesser talented and lesser accomplished people who are better off financially, than me.","I've done a lot of work on myself with regards to volatility and initmacy and I am in a good place with that thanks to therapy, but I do think one thing that is relevant is what I discovered with my daughter being born: I thought I had patience but it had always been restraint. I could always comport myself behaviour wise, but I had to recognize that I've always carried this tension, and I probably haven't worn it well... unless its a party and I'm drinking alcohol or consumed marijuana.","probably like 2 hours a day.

I was denied accomodations. I failed the test twice, when I'm certain I just needed more time.","I am sorry if I was not able to fill this out correctly.

I have not tested somewhere else for ADHD but I am exploring my options with ADDSOI.com.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6114382258125472717/6114382258125472717_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6114382258125472717/6114382258125472717_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6114382258125472717/6114382258125472717_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6114382258125472717/6114382258125472717_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6114382258125472717/6114382258125472717_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6114382258125472717/6114382258125472717_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6114382258125472717/6114382258125472717_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6114382258125472717/6114382258125472717_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6114382258125472717/6114382258125472717_base64_75_1735629027.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6114382258125472717/6114382258125472717_base64_76_1735629027.png,No,Julija,Zubac,"Jul 17, 1984","6049 Fry St",,"Bell Gardens",CA,90201,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

I have been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with a short interview process but it was not formal testing.  i wonder if ADHD is a true diagnosis or misdiagnosis because i likely have autism Which was never mentioned until recently. 

I also struggle with depression, anxiety, social issues, easily overwhelmed, trouble getting motivated to do tasks that are so easy for other people.  Also does the testing look for sensory processing disorder? I am unclear on the difference of that and the sensory overstimulation and sensory overload issues that go along with autism","Bullying and excessive teasing in junior high.  possible slight parental emotional unavailability at times as child - I am unclear on this but my recent therapist sees this in my history.  I don’t think I am writing it the way she worded if.","quickly become disregulated with change or noises, I have been excessively overwhelmed and tearful in the last few months but more recently seem to be irritable but still emotional at times as well, simple things are so hard for me to do like showering and brushing my teeth and flossing. Such simple things and keeping my house semi clean and uncluttered seems impossible. And I just seem to be unable to do simple tasks that need to get done and that anybody else wouldn’t think twice about. And I’ll spend my whole day off doing nothing but watching TV and avoiding life. It’s so hard to get moving motivated and I guess the world just seems unsafe from what every recently been talking with the therapist so my brain just wants to escape and hide and not deal with the world. I’ve had an eating disorder for 29 years. And binging purge daily it seems to be such a part of my life and it’s a maladaptive way of coping to escape and decompress and not think about deal with everything that happens during the day or that I’m worried about, in the future. My brain is so easily overwhelmed because it’s constantly processing sensory stuff and conversations that I had I’m going to have nitpicking the little tiny details of things that nobody else would even notice or think twice about. I’m always over thinking in my brain is exhausted. No wonder I want to run away, from my head and disengage and decompress unfortunately it’ uses maladaptive coping mechanisms To do so","Concussion Previously","Bulimia
Binge eating","Must  take meds to sleep. Sleep is not good because I get distracted and caught up
In watching tv/ binging and purging for hours or something else like looking at amazon while watching tv too.  I am tired when I get home and want to go to bed early but hours go by and then I am so engaged in my maladaptive coping mechanisms that by the time I take my meds and go to bed it can be 1.2,3 or 4am.  Obviously If I knew how to “just go to bed earlier or just take your meds earlier” i would have done so by now.","Much therapy. Meds. I’ve been to eating disorder treatment three or four times in the last 25 years. And that type of environment seems to make my Mental Health symptoms worse and looking back I think it’s because I was forced to be in such a social environment which is completely overstimulating an overwhelming. But in that environment it’s just looked upon as, being upset because you’re dealing with your eating disorder. I don’t know if that makes sense. I’m not good at doing relaxation things. It’s like my brain just can’t seem to go there. It wants to run it a frantic pace and it overthink over processes every little detail.    But the recent realisation of possible ASD could mean everything that I’ve tried for the last so many years was not focusing and realising what was actually the underlying issue so many of my symptoms. I’ve been doing a peach program for the last 2 1/2 months and several of the staff there think it’s very possible I have autism.","Currently seeing therapist and doing a program and seeing a psychiatrist.

I try hardly to ever take it but my psychiatrist tells me it’s okay to take it because of an anxiety is so high but I don’t want to get dependent on it so I hardly ever take it even though helps immensely if I really need it. I don’t take it more than once every two weeks at this point. There are so many more med and doses, but I’m gonna have to give it all to you guys again so I’ll write it out for you later.",No,"Yes.

Wellbutrin (100mg SR) was helpful for ADHD, but created severe insomnia so I stopped.
Propranolol (20mg) was very helpful for situational anxiety.
Lexapro (5mg) was very helpful for supporting me through a period in my life where I was suffering from generalized anxiety disorder.
Mirtazapine (7.5mg, 15mg) was prescribed for wellbutrin induced insomnia and was very heavily sedating.
Qelbree (100mg) did not help with ADHD and also caused insomnia.
Vyvanse (20mg) helped with focus, but had too many side effects - high heart rate, dry mouth, loss of apetite, anxiety.
Dexedrine (5mg, 10mg) very helpful for ADHD and focus. Would have to slowly titrate up from 5mg to a cruising of 10mg, and then would need to be careful to start at a lower dose from cruising if I took an extended break (vacation, etc.) Starting at 10mg after 2 weeks off would be too much and I'd feel over stimulated.",No,No,"Looking back, in my late teens and early 20s, I probably drank too much alcohol in order to counteract my social anxiety.","Generalized Anxiety Disorder - no longer take lexapro.

I also have to externalize many of my thoughts, or make sure that things are visible or I'll forget about them.

Wellbutrin (100mg SR) was helpful for ADHD, but created severe insomnia so I stopped.
Propranolol (20mg) was very helpful for situational anxiety.
Lexapro (5mg) was very helpful for supporting me through a period in my life where I was suffering from generalized anxiety disorder.
Mirtazapine (7.5mg, 15mg) was prescribed for wellbutrin induced insomnia and was very heavily sedating.
Qelbree (100mg) did not help with ADHD and also caused insomnia.
Vyvanse (20mg) helped with focus, but had too many side effects - high heart rate, dry mouth, loss of apetite, anxiety.
Dexedrine (5mg, 10mg) very helpful for ADHD and focus. Would have to slowly titrate up from 5mg to a cruising of 10mg, and then would need to be careful to start at a lower dose from cruising if I took an extended break (vacation, etc.) Starting at 10mg after 2 weeks off would be too much and I'd feel over stimulated.",No,No,"Looking back, in my late teens and early 20s, I probably drank too much alcohol in order to counteract my social anxiety.","Generalized Anxiety Disorder - no longer take lexapro.

I have a very hard time with drifting attention, especially when l'm either anxious about the task or it is unpleasant/boring. This test, however, was mostly memory puzzles testing short term memory and attention (i.e. replicate a complicated shape then drawing it again form memory, repeating back increasingly complicated strings of numbers, listening to a short story then reciting back remembered details, etc). These happen to be things I have always excelled at, and simply saw them as fun little puzzles, no more difficult than a crossword or sudoku. There were no external distractions as we ran through them, and the tests were usually short enough and interesting enough to me that I could zero in on them easily. It might have been testing ADHD, but I didn't feel like it was testing *MY* ADHD.

From what friends who take medication for their ADHD have told me, the primary function of it is to cut out the noise, bring you from so many thoughts at once down to just a few. As someone who has struggled with depression and anxiety, I understand a diagnosis and medication aren't a magic bullet, that other coping methods are needed on top of the medication. But I am hoping this might allow me to actually utilize those methods effectively, instead of running into the brick wall of distraction, mental noise, and exhaustion.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6099434190495218909/6099434190495218909_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6099434190495218909/6099434190495218909_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6099434190495218909/6099434190495218909_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6099434190495218909/6099434190495218909_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6099434190495218909/6099434190495218909_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6099434190495218909/6099434190495218909_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6099434190495218909/6099434190495218909_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6099434190495218909/6099434190495218909_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6099434190495218909/6099434190495218909_base64_75_1734134221.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6099434190495218909/6099434190495218909_base64_76_1734134222.png,Yes,Ryan,Biggins,"May 27, 1991","115 Circuit Rd",,Medford,MA,02155,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

"Dec 12, 2024","Shalissa Arias",9785787569,"Jul 10, 2002",Female,She/Her,shalissaarias1885@gmail.com,"51 Simon St","Apt 1",Beverly,Ma,01915,"ADHD
Autism","lack of motivation
procrastination
fidgeting
difficulty staying with one train of thought
difficulty completing tasks
forgetting multi step instructions","At some point, I think I would like to go back and try college again after I find some answers through this. I struggled a lot with focusing and keeping up with the work even though I did really good in high school and middle school. I'd like to learn to not be demotivated by my past self because I know it will be different this time. 

I definitely need assistance with motivation as well. I'm struggling to stay motivated to do things and often find myself thinking about what I need to do but not physically or mentally being able to commit to it.","I was physically, verbally, and emotionally abused as a child. My mother has bipolar so we'd often have to deal with the highs and lows of that. During the lows, I'd often have to become the parent for my younger siblings but I was still in elementary school at the time. Some events come up in nightmares and I try my best to avoid my mother in public as much as I can now that we've been separated.","My mood issues aren't as bad now as they were about a year ago. Sometimes I struggle with getting out of bed before work but I try to practice Opposite Action for that and it's helped get me to work on time still. My psychiatrist said I have PMDD so I often deal with mood swings, irritability, and self harm thoughts around my cycle. 

I often struggle with social anxiety but it has gotten a little better now as well. I have trouble with keeping up conversations and usually resort to short-worded responses to end the conversation quickly.","I've never had a head injury before.","Emotional over eating","I struggle with staying asleep every night and I always have. I often toss and turn and any little change in the environment often wakes me up. I was prescribed hydroxyzine and clonidine to help with anxiety at night and then I usually have to pair those with a 30mg edible to really stay asleep throughout the night. All three together have really helped a lot. I also listen to brown noise to help with falling asleep that way I can focus on the gentle noise instead of focusing on other distracting noises or my thoughts.","I've tried only really tried therapy. I don't really like self help books, meditation, or yoga. I like being able to talk through my issues because sometimes it helps me shift my thinking to hear a different perspective on what happens in my life or what my thoughts are.","I currently see a therapist every week and I see a psychiatrist about once a month. I've been seeing both for about a year and a half now. My therapist's name is Chris Mellen and my psychiatrist's name is Robyn Kinsherf I think.","I have been taking abilify for about a year and a half now. My dosage recently was upped to 10mg. I've tried 5 or 10mg of Lexapro. It was good at first but then a week before my period it made me experience mania or hypomania symptoms. I was taken off of it after that.","I've only ever experienced some mania symptoms when I was on Lexapro but other than that I haven't really had any other symptoms of psychosis.","About a year ago I struggled a lot with self-harming behaviors and suicidal ideation. It usually only gets bad when I'm about a week away from my period happening. My psychiatrist said I have PMDD. I have a lot of mental health tools I'm able to use now that's helped out a lot in reducing how bad the self-harm thoughts can get.","I only use edibles now. I use them to help with sleep and to help calm down after work. It helps me forget the stress I had to deal with during my shift. I also use it to reduce anxiety in some social situations or to make other things more enjoyable like movies or food.","I was recently told I have plantar fasciitis which makes it difficult to exercise or move around after work but I don't take medication for it. I do take medication to help with weight loss. I take 500mg of Metformin every morning with breakfast.","My mother was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and then my grandfather on my mother's side had committed suicide before I was born. I'm not connected with my paternal side so I'm not sure if there's anything there.",N/A,"I don't really remember if I met them all on time. I know I excelled in school a lot if that helps at all.","Right now I'm really into Crocheting. I spend most of my time crocheting but recently I've been getting a little bored and impatient with it. This happened as well with my other hobby when I was interested in all things nail polish and painting my nails. I got super into it and spent lots of money on that hobby and then a few months later I just stopped doing it because I got bored and impatient with it.","No not that I'm aware of.","I live with my Grandma, one of my little sisters, and my older brother. I used to share a room with 3 of my younger sisters but two of them have moved out so now I just share it with my younger sister that is 11 years old.","When I was in 5th grade I was separated from my other siblings and my mother. She left me at my grandmother's house and took the rest of my siblings to live with my older sister/motels since they were homeless. About a year later my mother was arrested and then my grandmother had to adopt three of my sisters back into the family at my grandma's house. This was really stressful for me because I went from having the room to myself to sharing it with 3 of my sisters. We weren't really compatible with each other at all (I still love them though we just weren't very friendly with each other when we were together).

Before this we also moved around a lot again from motel to apartment to motel again. I switched schools once in elementary school but I was still able to do good even with the moving around. 

About a week before this Thanksgiving that just passed we also had to put down our family cat that I've been with since 2nd grade(I'm 22 now so I was with him for a long time). I'm still struggling a lot with that loss since I was the closest to him.","My mother had bipolar disorder so we struggled a lot dealing with her symptoms and how she handled her mental illness. She often resorted to drugs, alcohol, and bringing a lot of men into the household/partying. I would often have to take over as the parent of my younger siblings when she was struggling the most but this was when I was still in elementary school. 

I had 3-4 siblings living with me at the time(one was born later closer to when we separated). I was always around them but I would still feel alone or different from them a lot of the time. Our neighbors or new people we met would prefer to spend time with my siblings over me. They thought there was something wrong with me or that I was weird/too fat for my age. I always felt like the black sheep of the family.

We were also physically abused by my mother as well. If we did anything ""bad"" in her eyes she would hit us with her belt(usually the one with spikes). There was one time she hit me with a wooden board.

Another thing that really impacted me was how my mother drove. She would drive recklessly with all of us in the car. Now whenever I get in a car or try to drive a car myself I start panicking if it feels like we're going fast. I have a really hard time on the highway. I still haven't been able to go for my license because I'm afraid I'll hurt others like how she did with the amount of accidents she was in due to her driving.

When I was in elementary/middle/high school I was able to get all A's as grades so I could try and get more attention from my mother. It worked a little bit but she usually didn't care. I was also the lead in a few plays in elementary school so I could get more attention as well and prove her wrong when she didn't believe I could do it due to how ""weird"" I was.

I don't know much about my paternal side. My father was not involved in my life but I think that was because of my mother. She did that with all of our fathers.","I'm really good at being able to listen to people and helping them with their issues. I really enjoy helping others even if it's just keeping them company when they need it. I kind of overly make myself available to my friends with this too.","I don't have trouble with maintaining friendships but I really struggle with making new friends. I made all the friends I have now in high school and they were the ones to initiate the friendship and I kinda just went with it(which I'm very glad I did). I'd like to learn how to make new friends so I have more people to spend time with. I also feel like I'll just tire myself out and stop talking to them though.","I'm very afraid to dive into the whole dating thing. I think I'd like to in the future but also I feel like I'm Asexual/Aromantic so I'm not really sure if I'll ever find someone that's okay with less intimacy/no sex. 

I'm mostly concerned with what my family would think of any partners I find, I wouldn't want to get them involved with my family at all.","I think I use social media about 5-ish hours per day. I usually switch through Instagram, Tik Tok, and Youtube. Sometimes I'll watch a Youtube video while scrolling on Tik Tok or Instagram just to have more noise around me when I need it. I might also be listening to music on Spotify at the same time as all of that too sometimes for more noise.","I have no other testing coming up anywhere else. This is my first time being tested.",N/A,"I did really good in Elementary, Middle, and High School but as soon as I got to college I did terribly. I started having panic attacks and just wasn't able to focus on the work and it led to me dropping out my first semester.","I think I shared everything I could remember as of right now. I've always felt different from others but I could never really explain why besides just being more quiet than others. I'm excited to start this process and potentially get more answers on this!",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6098576480418294903/6098576480418294903_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6098576480418294903/6098576480418294903_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6098576480418294903/6098576480418294903_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6098576480418294903/6098576480418294903_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6098576480418294903/6098576480418294903_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6098576480418294903/6098576480418294903_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6098576480418294903/6098576480418294903_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6098576480418294903/6098576480418294903_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6098576480418294903/6098576480418294903_base64_75_1734048450.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6098576480418294903/6098576480418294903_base64_76_1734048451.png,Yes,Shalissa,Arias,"Jul 10, 2002","51 Simon St","Apt 1",Beverly,Ma,01915,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

I grew up most of my life wanting to be with my mother, although during regular visits to see her (bi weekly for the weekend) she would without fail scream at me for hours.  I avoid most social interactions or dread doing them; even things I believe will be enjoyable.  It has always been a struggle to focus or maintain anything long term.  I have much anxiety over school especially, but I have a goal of obtaining an LCSW.  I am a recovering addict with over 5 years clean today.  I had started using in high school and was out of control through much of my 20's.  I have a pattern of completing dropping an entire friend group and starting all over.","Cannot maintain a routine.  I can sleep all day and am chronically tired.  I have a strong fear of rejection and of how I am being received.  This makes it painful to be in social settings.  I do not know how to act and sometimes it feels more comfortable to put up walls or barrier and not focus on giving anyone anything to make judgements on me.  I have plans while at work about all the things that I'll do over the weekend to be productive (when I'll have time to get things done) and the weekends come and I cannot get started on anything and I feel stuck.","No.  I had been diagnosed with epilepsy, but this was from induced from drug use.","Orthorexia (disordered eating under the guise of ""healthy or clean eating""

I wake up throughout the night sometimes with much difficulty trying to fall back to sleep.","Therapy, Psychiatry, OTC supplements, exercise, yoga, 12 step meetings.  Exercise if anything seemed the best for my overall mood, but was not helpful in my focus at home, work and school.","I am currently with a psychiatrist and had a therapist up until a couple weeks ago.  I believe she must have had a life emergency because she stopped seeing me abruptly.

I had a year in high school of a chronic feeling of nausea and having the sensation I had to go pee due a traumatic falling out with my mother.","When younger I used to cut myself and hit myself.  Huge bouts of rage and depression.  I wanted to kill myself many times towards the last few years of using drugs.","yes.  Opiates allowed me to feel normal.  I could socialize, I thought I could do everything better.  sleep, friends, work, play better music, everything seemed to fall into place when I found opiates.  Later on I found crack cocaine that really took me into a downhill turn to rock bottom.  Psychosis doesn't fit with with me outside of drug use.  I feel I have had mental break downs outside of drug use, but I wouldn't call those psychosis.","Depression/anxiety/PTSD

Currently being treated for depression and anxiety - titrating off escitalopram and starting Pristiq.

My psychiatrist is wary prescribing me anything for ADHD as she explains it is difficult for her to evaluate in adulthood due to individuals being able to find ways to adapt throughout their life.

Speech therapist as a child.","I live with my significant other in a 2 bedroom apartment.",no,"My mother and father parented me as polar opposites.  My mom acted as a volatile friend and my dad was strict and structured.  I longed to see my mother from as early as I can remember.  My dad was distant especially as I got older.  I moved a lot as a kid having been to 3 elementary schools before 4th grade.  I felt lonely and had a poor self esteem.  Looking back I see my parents are both sick people and could have really used help when they were raising me.  My mom had so much rage and said and did so much horrible things to me.  Mostly screaming at me.  She was constantly hot and cold.  She never apologized and conveniently would forget any wrong doings on her part, but always could recall anything she perceived I did to her; sometimes recalling an incident years into the past for sake of continuing one of her screaming matches.  My dad had started using drugs when my step mom divorced him and our relationship has been estranged now for the past 10+ years.","I believe I'm very in tuned with people's personalities and have a sensibility with putting on the mask that will best fit another person.  I have been friendly with many different types of people.  I'm funny, creative, and smart.  I can be efficient and find ways to streamline tasks.  I can overcome fear and do things that terrify me.","Initiating is a huge difficulty.  Maintaining as well.  as a young adult I had a huge network of friends, but much of this was living at the ""hang out house"" or playing music or from drug use.  Today I have a small group of friends, but nothing intimate.  Other than my girlfriend I don't have people that I spend a lot of regular time with.  Drama is not present today, but in past romantic relationships it was; also linked to drug abuse.","Today my motivation is a huge barrier in my relationship.  It is hard for me to function and I can only imagine the strain it puts on my girlfriend.  Most of the time she is amazing and supportive, but at times she has used comments like ""you're like living with a child"".  These are hurtful and I don't mean to hurt, but I feel utterly loss at finding words to explain what is going on in my mind when I have been home all day and not completed any task.","anywhere between 2-8hrs YouTube, reddit and tik Tok.",no,"Los Angeles Pierce College","teacher concerns, behavior concerns, homework, almost half back a grade, almost didn't graduate highschool.

occupational or relational impairment","Intrusive thoughts, motivation at work","Starting from a young age, I was neglected, physically and sexually abused, subjected to violence, guilt tripped, and so on by my parents, but predominantly by my father. When I was in college, my parents extorted me by threatening to stop paying for school. I have since cut off my parents and was diagnosed with CPTSD and PMDD.","In general, I have trouble getting up from time to time and I have intrusive thoughts frequently ranging in scope, but often related to my abuse growing up. I know I will never act on anything, but the thoughts are still there. Further, I am recovering from a rough period in my relationship with my husband, during which his own mental health issues caused me a lot of grief. I sometimes get triggered when reminded of his old behaviors and that causes me to become angry, throw tantrums, and be irritable, even if we were very happy just moments before. It is very difficult for me to move on as I get reminded every now and again, even though he has mostly changed since, and the worst of it was over a year ago at this point.",No,"Orthorexia (disordered eating under the guise of ""healthy or clean eating""
Binge eating
Emotional over eating","Sleep was very difficult for me my whole life until a couple years ago when my husband, then boyfriend, helped show me the importance of sleep. I was also diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, which I now take medication for, which has also greatly improved my sleep.","I have invested a lot of time into therapy, researching self help material, going through the motions with coaching my husband through his journey, and I even was diagnosed with ADHD before. That diagnosis, however, came from a staff member from my university's health clinic after a fifteen minute conversation, so I don't think it is valid. I was prescribed ritalin, which I felt uncomfortable while using. I am not sure if it was the medication or the fact I also had unmanaged CPTSD and depression.","I saw a therapist, Matthew King, for approximately 2 years while in college, 3 years ago. More recently I saw Dr. Amy Huang for about a year for therapy using EMDR methods, but have stopped seeing her a few months ago, as I believe I have gotten as far as I can talking about my trauma with that technique. I do not see a therapist currently.

I have a psychiatrist, Dr. Sen Sen Liu, whom I've been seeing for about two years.","I am currently taking zoloft, 25mg for my PMDD. It is effective for me and I have not noticed any adverse effects.",No,"I occasionally have suicidal ideations, but they are mostly minor. Sometimes when I am really upset, particularly with my husband, I feel more suicidal, but not to an extent to which I would do anything. As for self harm, I once considered cutting when I was younger, but I thought to myself that I do not want to damage my skin, since I care a lot about skincare and my body. I do not consider doing any self harm due to this logic.","There was a time early in college when I smoked marijuana in order to numb myself, but also as a tool to be social. I was never out of control or overly habitual with it, but it was something I did somewhat frequently. My husband, boyfriend at the time, who does not take any drugs and was concerned about me and convinced me to stop. I picked up smoking marijuana again in very small quantities, about once every two or three months, as a way to relax and meditate in a way.","I was diagnosed with PMDD/depression for which I take zoloft; I was diagnosed with CPTSD; I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism/graves disease for which I take methimazole","I have cut my parents off about four years ago, but when I was still in contact, both exhibited depression and what I would imagine were some personality disorders. I have seriously suspected my whole life that my father has some form of narcissistic personality disorder as well.","Have not been pregnant",Yes,"I exercise, cook, bake, and read. My husband and I meet up with some friends on occasion, but usually we spend all of our time together. My husband and I spend practically all of our time outside of work together doing all kinds of activities.","No, but I am scheduled to see a physical therapist in January 2025 for chronic muscle pain in my shoulder that I have had practically my whole life. I suspect it is from being yanked by my arm by my father while growing up.","I live in an apartment with my husband. We do not have any kids but are planning on having some in a few years' time so we are mentally preparing for that. We want to move to a larger place and are saving up for a house in the longer term. Despite not living together, I call my little sister every day as she lives in Illinois, so it is almost like she is here with me.","I cut my parents off about four years ago shortly after my grandmother who lived with them died. She was one of the only reasons for me to go back to my parent's house.
My younger sister, cousin, older brother, and I all recently and independently cut off my older sister, and I was the last one to do so. She is sour, entitled, aggressive, and viciously jealous of the relationship I have with my little sister. She was already cut off by our cousins, and friends who have met her realized quickly that she is out of control.","My parents are both immigrants, so they have a particular mentality around that, expecting me to stick to Filipino traditions, particularly where the parents are always right and children are supposed to do anything that they are told to do. There was a lot of volatility, and they made us move multiple times, in the same area but back and forth between two different school districts, which was difficult for me socially in school.

My paternal grandfather is a chronic gambler.","I am resilient (out of necessity), I am a planner, I am strategic, I am very caring and loving, I am principled, I am serious and take great pride in how I present myself, I am intelligent","Generally no, I keep in touch with a lot of my friends reaching back to middle school, though I have not attempted to initiate any friendships recently. I found a few times where I befriend people who I click with immediately, but the friendship would fall apart when the relationship would begin to turn toxic. Those friendships are not common for me, but they burn brightly and are quickly extinguished so they stand out.","I have trust and sexual issues with my husband. There was a time in the beginning of our relationship when I was hypersexual, likely due to my trauma, and so we had a lot of sex. I started taking birth control, and that ended up decreasing my libido, but my husband had issues toning it down. I felt pressured and he was sometimes pushy. I lost trust for him as well as a result. I stopped taking birth control after a month or two. We have been maintaining a minimal sexual relationship for about five years, having sex about once a month only. My husband has since changed and is actively working on himself and improving, but I am constantly scared of him picking up his old sexual behaviors if we start having sex consistently. He has shown a lot of growth, but I still don't feel safe due to the past.","I spend an hour or two on tiktok a day, but just recently I was on for four or more hours a day before I picked reading back up.","No official testing within a year or planned",n/a,"I graduated from my university with a Bachelor's degree. I did have difficulty paying attention in class and had difficulty beginning assignments I knew would be hard.","Referring to the eating disorders question, I want to clarify my situation:

A few years ago, my husband and I were very big eaters and we gained a good amount of weight during the pandemic. We would over order at restaurants and practically binge. In fall 2022, a year before our wedding, my husband and I worked with a personal trainer who was very strict on diet. We would initially not be able to maintain the diet and binge from time to time. We eventually stuck to the diet, but she ended up giving us orthorexia- which she herself surely has. After the cut, we would really crave the junk food that we couldn't eat and would find opportunities to eat it, though we had few binges. Nowadays, we kept our physiques for over a year now and we feel uncomfortable when we eat unhealthy, particularly oily food. That being said, I still might have some level of orthorexia and also occasionally have the desire to binge.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091904257768471778/6091904257768471778_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091904257768471778/6091904257768471778_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091904257768471778/6091904257768471778_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091904257768471778/6091904257768471778_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091904257768471778/6091904257768471778_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091904257768471778/6091904257768471778_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091904257768471778/6091904257768471778_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091904257768471778/6091904257768471778_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091904257768471778/6091904257768471778_base64_75_1733381226.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091904257768471778/6091904257768471778_base64_76_1733381227.png,No,Michael,Berutti,"Nov 3, 1997","28 North Almaden Ave Apt 604",,"San Jose",CALIFORNIA,95110,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

Newly struggling with irritability (past 1-2 years).",None,"Picky eater","Sleeping consistently has always been an issue, either too much 10+ hours or too little <5 hours. Have only maintained a decent sleep schedule for a few weeks or months at a time.  Previously prescribed Trazodone and Doxepin, side effects were not good.","Been on various psych meds since age 19, usually from a psychiatrist but have needed GP to fill gap when moving or insurance issues.  Been on 10+ different meds over the years, struggling to find the right regimen. 
Saw talk therapist 2020-2022ish.  She was very helpful and challenged me in a productive way. Have struggled to find a new one since I moved states (lots of “postive thinking” and mediation that I didnt find useful). 
Have struggled to find a good excercise routine but have been better about going on bike rides and walks over past year.","Current psychiatrist since 2023: Jaroslava Pohankova

2017-2019 psychiatrist: John Hettema

Misc primary care and short term psych in between

Cant remember long term therapist’s last name","Current: Caplyta 42mg, Wellbutrin XL 300mg, Hydroxizine 20 mg

Previous (in orderish): Lexapro, Atavan (as needed), Trazodone(sleep), Doxepin(sleep), Zoloft (allergic), Proazac (main ~5years, cant tolerate >20mg), Wellbutrin (since 2020), Remeron (caused a lot of irritability), Effexor (tolerated low dose ok but higher made me a bit irritable, tapering off was a nightmare), Latuda (restless leg kept me awake and nausea) Caplyta (since Oct 2024)","Some hypomania (hyperactive, irritable) but chief complaint has always been depression/anxiety
No psychosis","Attempted suicide via Atavan at age 22. Hospitalized ~3 days.","Tried pot in college, did not like the way it made me feel. Used alcohol to dial back the anxiety in early 20s.","Current: Bipolar II or Depression with Mixed features? (Difficulty determining which)

Previous: PTSD (car accident), anxiety and depression (vague), OCD (have gone through periods of obsessive handwashing and fears of contiamination). 

Non psych: eczema, fibrous Displasia","Maternal grandmother likely had depression 

Father has dramatic mood swings and obsession with self image",None,"Met milestones as expected, was an early reader","Hobbies include: gaming, cooking, traveling, crafting

Tryint to make more local friends since husband and I moved to LA in 2023",None,"Husband and 2 cats in apartment, we have a house back in Syracuse and we stay in to see family throughout the year","Married in October 2024
Moved to LA in July 2023","Parents marriage was never good, separated when I was 5, actual divorce process took 2+ years, there was a lot of “mud slinging” from my dad at my mom. Dad has always been moody and inconsistent, mom was source of stability.  Split custody arrangement was messy and stressful. Dad sort of “replaced” me with an new family when he married his wife (20 years younger) when I was 14, getting asked to move all my stuff out when I came out at 16 felt sort of inevitable. Living with mom full time made my day to day way better, she’s very consistent and supportive of me (her parents were also a huge part of my life). Im very close with my mom’s side and my husband’s family. Limited contact with dad so I can have a relationship with my 14 year old half sister.","Meticulous in my work, passionate, outgoing, creative","Have an easy enough time making friends but the circle always shrinks when I move states, I try to visit at least once a year. Try to see maternal family and inlaws a couple times a year. 

Most dramatic relationship is with my dad and I try to limit interactions.","Have struggled with libido from previous meds and high anxiety, feels like it’s one of those all or nothing things for me. I’m bisexual but my husband and I’s relationship is monogamous.","Most social media is listening to long form YouTube videos while doing something else or scrolling sorts (I hate how you get sucked in and wish I could shut that part of the app off).","No prior testing, several teachers in elementary school recommended I get evaluated for ADHD but dad refused and now that I’m an adult other things seem more likely so I never followed up either",N/a,"Have always been academically inclined, good grades, lot of extra curriculars, wanted to be an engineer from age 9. Got BS in Computer Engineering in 2019.  I liked college but the lack of stability wasn’t good for me and I feel like I barely finished my last year. 

Started MS in Electrical Engineering in 2023 but dropped because life got to busy and it wasn’t really furthering my professional goals. I’d like to have time to finish one day just for myself.",,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091720976423237387/6091720976423237387_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091720976423237387/6091720976423237387_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091720976423237387/6091720976423237387_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091720976423237387/6091720976423237387_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091720976423237387/6091720976423237387_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091720976423237387/6091720976423237387_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091720976423237387/6091720976423237387_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091720976423237387/6091720976423237387_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091720976423237387/6091720976423237387_base64_75_1733362898.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6091720976423237387/6091720976423237387_base64_76_1733362898.png,No,Kathryn,Hutchins-Duda,"Feb 27, 1996","360 The Village","Apt 105","Redondo Beach",CA,90277,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

Binge eating
Emotional over eating","I sometimes use rain sounds to fall asleep or use a fan (for the noise). I have trouble sleeping comfortably at night due to having sleep apnea. It’s hard to shut my brain off sometimes without exhaustion being the reason I fall asleep.","I am currently in therapy and trying my best to go to church. Therapy is such a huge help.","I am currently seeing a therapist. Her name is Elizabeth B at Neponset Health Center in Dorchester, MA.","I was prescribed a medication I don’t remember the name but I never took it because I didn’t feel the psychiatrist actually listened to my concerns and just prescribed me medications.","Not that I am aware of, no.",No,"No issues","I have chronic asthma and I take ventolin inhaler (albuteral) and advair.","Not sure.","Never been pregnant.","I believe so","I try to go to the gym",No,"I currently live with my boyfriend but I used to live with my mother, step father and younger brother.","Leaving my current job and starting school in the winter (late January).","I was constantly moving schools but also we were homeless for a few months when I was around 16 years old ish. I was held back in the 8th grade twice and had to redo that grade three times. I felt alone a lot because I am the oldest daughter/child and I became the parentified child.

My brother has an intellectual disability and had/has speech problems especially when he was younger. Pretty sure my mother has some form of depression/eating disorder.

Now as an adult it is a lot harder to maintain them. No drama but more so just isolation from friends and then just not really speaking with them.","I struggle with codependency, sometimes emotional regulation, trust (due to my past) and sometimes I struggle with intimacy.","I spend most of my time on TikTok. It is an addiction/bad habit that I want to break out of but it is hard because it has become the one thing that has been able to stimulate my brain by also rotting it at the same time.","I have not been tested for anything but I would like to be tested before school starts for me.","Bunker Hill Community College","I would like to get tested so that I can show if I need an IEP or get extra help regarding schoolwork and homework.

I was supposed to graduate high school at the age of 16/17 but I ended up graduating at age 19 from high school.","I do not like to feel invalidated, dumb/stupid. I would rather my doctors tell me the truth straight even if it’s uncomfortable. I don’t like when doctors tend to beat around the bush.

occupational or relational impairment","I have explored the possibility of having ADHD symptoms with my primary therapist for quite some time. I would like to get a definitive assessment to determine if the symptoms that I am experiencing are due to other underlying physical/mental health conditions, or if it is ADHD. Over time I have compensated with good coping skills, however, it often leaves me with little or no energy to complete activities outside of work or to engage with my friends.","I have a history of trauma, but fortunately it does not present in the form of nightmares or flashbacks.","I often struggle with ""getting the day started"" which often leads me to be late for work or other appointments. I have also experienced periods of isolation during depressive episodes, and often feel overwhelmed in high energy settings.",None.,,"I generally sleep okay. I typically wake once or twice throughout the night and can normally fall asleep again. Occasionally, I'll have times where I struggle to fall asleep and end up staying awake for hours at a time.","I have been seeing my therapist regularly and have recently started seeing a psychiatrist, who recommended me to seek out a neuropsych assessment.","I have been seeing Brian Chao since March 2022 and Thomas Phan in October 2024.","I currently take 40mg of fluoxetine and feel that the medication is effective.",None.,None.,None.,"I have been diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism and is currently taking levothyroxine 50mcg.","There is a history of depression with my mother, and maternal grandmother, as well as my father.",N/A,"I believe so.","I enjoy crafting, crocheting, and reading.",No.,"I currently live in a multigenerational home with my mother, 3 sisters, 1 brother in law, and nephew. My household also contains 2 dogs and 1 cat.","In 2024, I have experienced the loss of my father in February. Additionally, I was exited from my doctoral program around the same time.","My parents are a product of war, my mother from the Khmer Rough, and my Father from the Vietnam War-- both of which were refugees before coming to the United States. I am the youngest of six daughters, with a significant age gap, so I spent much of my childhood playing by myself. My family was also not very well off, and we had periods of time where we used food stamps. We also moved 3 times during my child hood, and twice in my adulthood. My parents, though caring, I'm sure they struggled with PTSD and depression.","Generally I would say that I am knowledgeable, honest, and realistic.","I struggle with maintaining romantic relationships as other's may describe me as ""emotionally unavailable."" I have a core group of friends, but don't really have a larger group of friends as it is very energy draining even though I get along with most people.","In terms of dating and romantic relationships, I find it easy to maintain ""casual"" relationships vs serious ones. I have a hard time trusting others to treat me kindly as previous relationship experiences have been unfavorable.","I spend too much time on tiktok as I often participate in ""doom scrolling"" to pass the time. I also enjoy youtube shorts or other short form content as it doesn't require a lot of attention and energy.","I have not had any neuropsych testing done.",N/A,"In elementary and middle school, I took accelerated classes. Many teachers have said that I have potential to do well if I put in more effort. I also took honors and AP classes in high school, but did not do as well. I had summer school freshman - junior year as I struggled with math. I attended college and experienced depression throughout, but still graduated in 4 years with a 2.028 gpa. I attended USC for my MSW and did better, but still struggled with keeping up academically. I also attempted a doctoral program on 3 different occasions and have dropped out for various reasons.

Growing up I often felt isolated and resorted to isolating myself in my room or away from others. When I was upset I isolated and cried in private as to not be subject to judgement or questions from my parents who blamed me for my own distress. My youngest sister growing up had intense aggressive tantrums (screaming throwing hitting punching furniture) that my parents didn’t know how to handle. Family gatherings felt overwhelming and I’ve always been hypersensitive to noises, textures, and big groups This further made me feel isolated as we attended large family gatherings at least monthly. My mother also overreacted to small things frequently which left me confused then angry and bitter. Most memorably, when on a boat in the lake my dad good heartedly sprayed her with water and she wouldn’t talk to us for 2 days. Another time when she went to get an eyelash off my face without warning I flinched back and then she refused to talk to me for a week beside necessary communication (time to leave, eat dinner, etc.)","My best strengths and qualities are my observational skills around others behavior and empathy to situations.

I have little patience for drama or negativity, especially towards other and have no patience for those who act one way in front of one friend and then totally differently in front of others when it doesn’t serve a positive purpose. I have always had one or two close friends and have had them for a long time- childhood friends from our neighborhood growing up, 2 close friends since middle school. As an adult I have tended to become really good friends with other adults that are older than me- I feel like we have more similar perspectives and it lacks confusing drama.","Often I am anxious about my own deficits and in the past have had trouble not apologizing or overcompensating in other ways to feel better about it but I feel very understood and secure in my current relationship.","Typically an hour or less a day.

My therapist agrees my diagnoses would currently be GAD and OCD. I'm curious if there's even more to me, though. I'm very interested in my brain and what things I might be able to do or not do to help make my brain quieter/calmer and life easer.",No,"Mood swings, irritability, and can be excessively tearful on occasions especially during spikes of anxiety or overwhelm",No,,"I sleep well for the most part. I use melatonin to help on occasion. I also have my medicinal marijuana license and use that to help me sleep on occasion too. I sleep with the TV on sleep timer for background noise. I meditate before bed every night. Once I'm asleep I'll usually wake up a few times and roll over to fall back sleep each night (give or take depending on how tired I am).","I have tried everything listed in this question besides church because I'm Jewish. But I also haven't tried synagogue/temple. I'm a believer in the universe and a higher power but I'm not religious. As I said I'm already in therapy. I'm on medication for my anxiety and I meditate daily. I write in a gratitude journal daily. I read self-help books on occasion. I tried OTC supplements before I was medicated but since stopped. Now and then my husband and I will find motivation to go on walks after work together but I don't exercise as much as I should.","Yes

Wendy Dubin was my therapist from about March 2016 until the end of 2018. (she closed her private practice and I felt like I was good at that time)

Kelsey Biros is my husband and I's couples therapist (since 2023).","Yes, I'm currently on sertraline. I was on 25mg for years (since a year and a half or two into therapy the first time) and now I've been on 50mg for maybe about a year. I also have an emergency prescription for 5mg of Alprazolam. I have not had any adverse side effects to either besides perhaps weight gain on the sertraline.",No,No,No,"No other than GAD/OCD.","Not formally, but I have some opinions personally.","My mom smoked while I was pregnant and I was a preemie born 8 weeks early at 4lbs 13oz.","I think for the most part, yes","I have a book club with 5 of my friends.",No,"I live with my husband.","My parents have both been battling cancer (mom since August 2022, dad since July 2023) and my dad just found out in June 2024 that he has 3 months to a year to live. They did say likely closer to a year since he had no pain yet. He's still feeling well at the moment.","My parents were involved in my life. They held traditional gender roles with my dad working a lot and my mom mostly being a stay at home mom until I was in college. I believe both of my parents have anxiety and that that's a part of my own anxiety.","I think my strengths are empathy, creativity, attention to detail (when I'm at my best), and intelligence. I'm very loyal and care deeply about my people in my inner circle.","I was a late bloomer when it came to romantic relationships but I've always been able to maintain close friendships. I do feel like I have to mask around most people outside of my inner circle, and even sometimes in front of them depending.","I have trust issues that stem from anxiety and were made worse when I lost my virginity to someone who I thought was a no strings attached friend with benefits and turned out to be married with children.","Probably too many? I scroll a lot on my free time on the couch. I like to use Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. I also like to online window shop which sometimes turns into retail therapy which I've been working on reigning in.",No,n/a,"I was never on any formal plans in school or held back etc. I have my Masters and my C.A.G.S.","I'm excited to learn more about myself! I'm most curious about anxiety management and if ADD and/or Autism play any part in my thinking. ADD is more likely than Autism in my opinion. I also know that Anxiety and ADD can have overlapping symptoms so there's a shot I already know about my existing diagnoses but I'm hoping this will give me more information regardless. It might be important to know that before I tried any therapy or medication I experienced a bout of depression, and had a similar one after deaths in the family/the news about my dad (obviously hard times) so I'm not sure how big a role that plays for me. Also, my job feels relevant: I'm a second grade teacher. I plan to share this report with my therapist.

- Dad has had period of high stress / anxiety
- Mom definitely can be high strung, was depressed at some point
- Same with grandma on mom side...
- I believe Aunt on Mom's side has bipolar...? I think
- Brother is diagnosed with bipolar... uncertain which one it is

My History:
- I think I was experiencing something as a child... not diagnosed. Would throw absolute tantrums if I didn't push elevator button... parents said they would trust me with ""family jewels"" as a toddler because I wouldn't lose it.
- First panic attack at 17 sitting at table with parents, grandparents, younger brother. Rushed to ER... thought it was a heart attack... Got put on Lexapro... forget what the dosage was. Was also prescribed Klonopin but was advised to only take it during emergencies... to this day takes me about a year+ to get thru 20 pills.
- Got off Lexapro after 8ish months. Went to college. Was great until 19. Grandpa passed away, brother got married, college got real... first time kind of feeling depressed. Got put on Buspar because I liked going out, having a good time.
- At 20 - parents took me to get evaluated, thought I had OCD because I have had a hard time letting go of things and can kind of loop on them. Til this day have things that repeat in head, music typically playing, check things over and over when anxious, etc. Diagnosed with OCD - got put on Luvox.
- Was on Luvox until it got taken off my insurance and became too expensive... I was put on Prozac. At 23/24 - got hit with anxiety / depression bug - started seeing a therapist weekly that I still see to this day (monthly now)
- At 27... I know that I get hit a little bit with seasonal symptoms - was put on Wellbutrin but was taken off after revealed brother was Bipolar - I guess there is some risk of going manic on that drug? Dr wanted to up my dose a bunch and I didn't love that... requested a genetic test and found that Cymbalta could be a good fit. Got put on that which has been pretty positive.
- Got stable and haven't really had big issues til now. Had a couple of ups and downs over the years but overall have been pretty good. Mostly issues are fatigue oriented - hard to get out of bed.
- The last month or two have started to get some panic attacks which I haven't had since I was a teenager. Something isn't really clicking - so trying to get to the bottom of it and why I'm catching up with you.

Only Thoughts:
- Wanted to get an evaluation for mood disorder + adhd, per therapist

I usually wake up about 3 times in the night, but typically am able to fall back asleep when that happens. It is the initial falling asleep I struggle with. I use white noise and use CBD. I have used Trazadone in the past.","I try to do yoga, but it's really hard for me to stay consistent. I work in this field and a lot about me has come out, naturally. I have my own therapy and I also seek support through supervision when necessary. But with therapy, I feel like so much happens to me, that every week I just have to update a lot. This year was kind of one thing after the other.","Yes both. Danielle Heger until about a month ago, and due to leave, I am seeing Bryant Wilson at Nicely Counseling. I see a psychiatrist through Seahorse Behavioral Health, Katherine Orlowski","I am currently prescribed 40 mg of Fluoxetine and 5 mg of Busiprone. I am noticing that the Fluoextine is helping with my energy levels, as I used to be absolutely exhausted throughout my days and absolutely need multiple coffees, where now, I am fine on just one coffee (unless I have class as I am also a grad student). I have taken Trazadone 50 mg as well and noticed it helping, but ran into pharmacy issues and lsot the motivation to care about it and never called the pharmacy to do anything.","No, this doesn't happen for me","Before my period I do get extreme suicidal thoughts, but never any plan, attempt, or intent. I likely engage in self harming behaviors that I am unaware of, but there is nothing that comes to mind. I have a history of cutting when I was in high school. I also have made myself throw up in high school due to body image, and a couple of years ago I abused laxatives also due to body image/eating problems.","I regularly use marijuana and CBD to help myself sleep and to lower my anxiety. It significantly helps with my anxiety and calms my racing thoughts, giving myself an overall calmer sense of being. I have not experienced psychosis symptoms.","I have been diagnosed with a thoracic spine strain and was prescribed naproxen.","My mother grew up in the US foster care system. She came to the US from Ecuador at the age of about 3/4 and was not adopted until she was a young teenager. Her adopted father died when she was about 28 or so. So, significant trauma, mind you all unhealed. To this day she has not received mental health care. While in foster care she attempted suicide and on another occasion was given pills by her foster siblings. There is likely more I have not heard. There are no mental health diagnoses. For my father, there are also no mental health diagnoses. I would bet a could amount of money on him being on the spectrum, but again, no official diagnosis.","Entirely NA","Yes I believe I did","Not currently as I work full time and am a grad student","Physical therapist when I dislocated and fractured my knee cap when I was about 11.","I am currently living with my roommate. I am 23 years old as is she. We went to undergrad together and this is our second year living with one another post-grad. I also have two cats.","I moved homes 7 times before the age I was 15. Never in a different town, but between 2008 and 2015/16 we moved houses 7 times, and 2 of those times me, my mom, and my dad lived with my grandparents (paternal) in their two person home. My parents also heavily fought when I was a child, and then would out of nowhere be completely fine. It was inconsistent and I never knew what to expect. That also applies to my mom. Her reactions to things were inconsistent and I walked on egg shells quite a lot.","I feel like I have mentioned a lot of this above. I also felt very very very alone. I am an only child and never really felt like I had anyone on my side. I once wrote my dad a letter about how depressed and alone I felt and he told me that I wasnt alone and never brought it up again. My mom was inconsistent and there was nothing I could do that would ever be right, and not in a typical mother teenage daughter way. I truly couldn't chew wrong, breathe wrong, drink wrong, nothing. If I slightly annoyed her she got mad at me. I also mentioned earlier in this that I have a history of cutting, neither of my parents know about that to this day. I am unsure if there is substance abuse history on either family side.","I am incredibly resilient and have so much empathy and understanding for others. I truly feel that I am capable of helping others through their own journeys and have a genuine care that I don't think a lot of people have. I can also be funny from time to time","I have definitely had drama in relationships but I believe it was all due to my inability to self advocate that led to resentment and problems from my trauma. This does not really happen quite as much as I am a bit better at self advocating.","I definetely struggle with trust and emotional regulation with romantic relationships. I had a really unhealthy relationship when i was in high school and another unhealthy relationship when I was in college. The high school one I definetely was equal to blame, but the college I was not. I to this day with my current boyfriend struggle with trust and emotional regulation. If he tells me that I hurt his feelings I can logically understand what I did was wrong but I will likely have a meltdown because I feel so overwhelmingly guilty for hurting him.","I would say about 5 hours.",No,"Bridgewater State University Masters of Counseling Education on my first year","I struggled to complete homework a lot in highschool but didnt struggle enough for it to cause a big enough effect.","I put off doing this for a solid 2-3 weeks because it was long and overwhelming and I am doing it instead of working on my 20 page paper due at the end of the month and I just feel like that says something",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074492095918971397/6074492095918971397_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074492095918971397/6074492095918971397_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074492095918971397/6074492095918971397_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074492095918971397/6074492095918971397_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074492095918971397/6074492095918971397_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074492095918971397/6074492095918971397_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074492095918971397/6074492095918971397_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074492095918971397/6074492095918971397_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074492095918971397/6074492095918971397_base64_75_1731640011.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074492095918971397/6074492095918971397_base64_76_1731640012.png,,Jenna,Root,"Jan 31, 2001","7 Derry Park Drive",,Middelboro,MA,02346,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

It is interfering with my home life now. I have found myself in a crappy situation. Found myself isn't accurate either my actions put me here. I am involved in a case with DCF. My husband and I argue and it causes me to act in ways I find disgusting and ridiculous but I cannot stop myself and as a result of kicking my husband in front of my children I was removed from my home pending near-psych eval.

I want to learn to deal with stress and set backs in a much better way. I do not want to lose my family.","I have a history of trauma. It wasn't physical or sexual. It was growing up in a chaotic home, without a lot of support for issues, or guidance on how to live life. Ive only felt unconditional love from my maternal grandmother who died when I was 21. I thought I had that with my husband but now I can see it is not unconditional. I can't pinpoint one specific traumatic event. It was a lifelong feeling of being anxious in my home never knowing when a big argument would happen. And now I have become that person in my own home and I cannot make that okay. I can't believe I did that knowing how much I hate it","I would say rage. I have a few things that I perseverate on. Mostly house updates that need to happen. And some with my relationship with my husband. I feel like he doesn't care about me. I don't see actions to support it but he insists he does and has reasons why he can't do X, Y, Z... I know he is partly correct but I also know that he could get these things done. So I end up in a state where it doesn't matter I am ruining a moment, or a day or a situation. I just want to be heard. And I want to know that the he knows he hurt me and how he did it and I make ridiculous claims about how I am going to fix it. I say things I don't mean during these times and also others. I know I don't mean them but he doesn't. I want to know how to feel heard. so I don't continue to hurt the people who love me by not being able to show them I love them.  I also think I may have PMDD. paying attention to my cycle and my moods has made both my husband and I believe that could be some of my problem.","I have experienced a diagnosed concussion, One MRI was performed. About ten years ago. I fell while snowboarding onto my stomach. Hit my head on the ground but due to the inertia my legs and entire board kept going and in a ""scorpion"" style move I hit the back of my head with my snowboard. I WAS wearing a helmet. I also experience a situation where I hit the back of my head while falling and I hit a table. I still have a scar and it hurts sometimes. I did not get any testing done for that.","Binge eating
Emotional over eating","I have a hard time sleeping on occasion. It seems like during my menstrual cycle I have two nights in a row I can't fall asleep or stay asleep. If something is bothering me emotionally it is hard to fall asleep. I need white noise, and I also sleep with an ear bud in one ear and my other ear against the pillow cuz my husband snores.","I am in therapy. I go to AA. I am working the steps but am only on the first ones. I had tried medication. I really felt like this year of being sober helped me out so much. I lost 70lbs. That has been awesome for my mental health and physical health. I am an LPN and I got into an RN bridge program which I am currently In the middle of completing. I was diagnosed with adhd and put on Adderal a couple months ago. I think the adderal caused me to feel rage in the way I had done work to change for myself. I was not wanting to see the truth in that as my anxiety around my education goals is also very high.","Yes, I am seeing a wonderful therapist named Meghan Arnold. I am a current patient and have seen her for 6+ months. I saw a Psychiatrist for the first time last week as part of my DCF plan. She took me off of the adderal and put me on 25mg Lamictal a day.","I took Celexa low dose for a long time. I did not notice any difference. I am currently on Lamictal 25mg a day but have only taken that for five days. If there is an effect it might be in my head, or I feel better because my period just ended and I think PMDD is a major part of my emotional issues. I know this medicaiton takes time to build up to therapeutic effect.","The way I get when I am angry has been described as Manic. It last for about 20mins. Until my husband removes himself or I remove myself from the situation. I don't recall any psychosis, grandiosity etc. I don't know if this counts as paranoia, but I get into moods where I can't see that anyone cares about me. I can only take actions and words as negative. Especially with my husband. He cares about me cuz he is still with me is what he says.","I have self harmed in the past.  It has been a long time since I did it. I have wanted too since then but didn't. Sometimes I think about not being here anymore. The word suicide feels harsh for how my emotions are actually. It's kind of like thinking about a tropical vacation or winning the lottery. Like, wouldn't that be nice. But it won't happen. I am not catholic anymore, and Ive wondered if my brain kept this piece as a form of self preservation. I believe I would spend eternity in hell if I end my own life.","I have not done a lot of drugs in my life. I have and continue to smoke weed to help relax. I only purchase from dispensaries for safety. I tried some recreational drugs in my 20s. I never felt like I needed them or wanted to try them again. Very grateful for that.","I have an ADHD diagnosis, I was taking 10-20mg XR a day with a 10mgIR in afternoons if I needed it. I can recall one time where I believed it was causing me to feel anger and I couldn't stop it, but it is hard to tell because that is a behavior I already have and want to change so bad.","yes. Only the past couple of weeks have I heard that on my paternal side there are mental health issues and couple of people have committed suicide. I am 38 years old.  I wish I knew prior to this.","I gained 100lbs in my first pregnancy. In my second I was diagnosed with a 2 vessel cord (versus 3) the c-section went well but my child ended up in the NICU. She was the healthiest baby there. I wasn't able to hold her for almost ten hours after.","I didn't walk for a very long time. I didn't know this until I had an MRI of my lumbar spine to see about arthritis and the doctor discovered a mild case of spina bifida. I didn't pull at the thread at that point. Sometimes I Wonder if she of my lower extremity pain/ bladder pain is from that. But it doesn't interfere with day to day life in a way I need to seek answers. Not like my emotional and mental health does.","yes. I go to aa a couple times a week. I hike and lift weights. As a family we are doing activities all the time outside. We snowboard and swim. I am also in an RN program and it is intense. Feels like a community group/hobby in one.","I worked as a team with them for my children but not for myself.","Prior to two weeks ago my living situation was - Me, My husband and two kids living in a home we own. It was awesome
Currently - DCF has me ""out of the home until further notice"" and I am staying with a friend and her kid in a house ten miles from my children and home. It is awful.","Yes. I have been removed two weeks ago. I feel like the one helium balloon floating away and everyone is watching and no one can stop it. I worked so hard this last year of being sober. I am losing it all anyway.","I felt alone a lot. I never felt supported. Any idea I had for my own life was met with negativity. I felt like every thought I had was wrong and bad. I wasnt a bad kid! They definitely have their own issues but mental health isnt real to them. I have just learned that family on my dad's side struggled with alcoholism and committed suicide.","I haven't given up. And I won't. I am not afraid to try new things.","some. I have lost a BEST friend to drama. But I also have many good friends. They are all from when I was a child. I don't have a hard time initiating relationships. I have a hard time when I have known them a long time and have a comfort with them. I haven't argued in ways like I do with my husband, but I feel like I have acted in ways I don't think others would, because they would recognize it as the wrong thing to do before doing it. Not after, like I find myself doing.","My husband is someone that I love so much. His actions hurt me because I love him so much. I really want to explore my emotions around him because he is a great man, a fantastic father, a dedicated and skilled employee, a good son. But I can't see where I fit into his priorities. I don't know if it's my mind or if in reality how I act has pushed him away. It is hard. It is mostly what I am worried about. Losing him, and also how I act to the ones I love. They should get the best of me not the worst!","Before two weeks ago Id say I spent about 2 hours on social media. I have been displaced from my home and am taking this incredibly new situation I am in to break habits like that. I deleted instagram and don't miss it. I have a Snapchat with about 10 friends on it. I have a Facebook for kids stuff and town information but don't spend a lot of time on it. I am down to 10-20 minutes on social media. Youtube, I spend a LOT of time on. There are fantastic resources for my current educational goals. I also watch shows on there. I use it as a from of distraction.",No,"Holyoke Community College","I am currently In an LPN to RN bridge program. I am having a hard time. My brain is one year off alcohol. I got better grades before I quit drinking. I have a 74.73 in the course and need to raise it to a 77 by the end of the semester to be allowed to go on to the next semester.","I am currently displaced from my home. My husband doesn't know If he wants to continue our marriage. DCF says I cannot go back to my home with no rubric or end date or what to do to get back and it feels like a very harsh punishment for my actual situation. I won't deny anything I have done to get here. But I can see other DCF cases having more leniency than mine. Being away from my kids is the most awful thing I have ever dealt with. I am being asked to get testing done and figure out how to be an even better person that I thought I was becoming and it is hard to see a light at the end of the tunnel , when the light has been extinguished. I worked this whole year trying to get better and it wasn't enough. I still lost almost everything.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074089027735746820/6074089027735746820_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074089027735746820/6074089027735746820_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074089027735746820/6074089027735746820_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074089027735746820/6074089027735746820_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074089027735746820/6074089027735746820_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074089027735746820/6074089027735746820_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074089027735746820/6074089027735746820_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074089027735746820/6074089027735746820_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074089027735746820/6074089027735746820_base64_75_1731599704.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6074089027735746820/6074089027735746820_base64_76_1731599704.png,,Robert,Breau,"Dec 23, 1983","6 Beulah Land Road",,Blandford,MA,01008,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

Mental hyperactivity; Inability to form or follow through with long-term plans. Mental shutdown when too many steps/options are present. Can't keep the same idea in my head for more than a minute.","Haven't felt safe in any home since the age of ~12, can not keep a job due to impulsivity, poor time management, inability to tolerate boredom, forgetfulness, no patience for minutiae, and possible displaced sense of justice.","Alcoholic father on a litany of psych meds and mother who can not seem to make Any decisions lead to an atmosphere of emotional abandonment and danger (which persists with my younger siblings) and missing out on fundamental developmental landmarks","No matter how much I sleep I never feel rested and often suffer sleep paralysis. I skipped depression and went straight to despair, realizing it feels like I died ten years ago and have nothing to fall back on nor any foundation or ability to build a future. I feel like I have ruined not only my own life but that of my long-time girlfriend, whom I can offer nothing of substance.","No notable head trauma, all head scans apparently normal.",,"I used to be pathologically afraid of sleep due to mystery symptoms that would prevent or interrupt it constantly (exploding head syndrome, sleep paralysis, occasional auditory hallucination, hypnic jerk, self-repeating stress dreams). Now I am constantly tired and only wake 2-4 times a night instead of 12-16, but the sleep I get is not restorative, despite having little to no issues with breathing. I listen to brown noise, which seems to help, and no longer require Quetiapine.","Three years ago I couldn't fall asleep for almost seven days. No amount of physical exhaustion, dim light reading, chamomile tea, binge drinking, podcasts, pot/pot brownies, meditation, or Nyquil could do the trick, only making the night time psychoses worse. That abated after time and I no longer require anything.","My parents never thought to address my concerns, certainly needing help themselves, and/or they simply couldn't afford such care. I have never seen a psychiatrist or therapist of any sort.","I took Buspirone HCL 5mg once a day for half a year, discontinued as it conferred no benefits, only making me more tired, which I can't afford, and seems to be the case with most anxiolytics/antipsychotics.
I took a small nibble of Quetiapine (Seroquel) 50mg tablets for a couple months, which was enough to put me to sleep but would cause day-ruining hangovers.
I was given Gabapentin 100mg which I discontinued immediately after it worsened my tremors to a full-body, all-day affair.
I have just been given Trazodone 50mg but have not yet started the course out of concern for past experiences.","Infrequent sleep paralysis and fairly common waking sleep state, where I am technically asleep but my conscious mind is active. Sometimes I hear someone from the family call my name from another room when there is no one around, always when trying to fall asleep or waking. In the aforementioned week with no sleep at all I saw cloudy, black tendrils in my room and heard conversations to the side of me. This was an outlier incident and has not returned. I sadly do not have enough energy for mania.","No, but I do feel like my future is hopeless without radical change or intervention.","I often employ a slow drip of low-dose alcohol to aid in mental clarity, as in my natural state my mind races too fast to read or finish thought strings. A long time ago I would drink to sleep when I was stuck in an abusive relationship and needed to work the next day.","Nothing I know of that isn't 'upstairs.'","My father may have been bipolar and I suspect had ADHD of the more outwardly pronounced type but didn't share his medical findings, wanting everyone off his back and out of his business. He was done in by a cocktail of approximately nine psych/pain meds and vodka. He had unresolved trauma from a childhood of abuse.

When my grandfather passes I will have nowhere to go. My mother, who lives a short ride away, is slowly losing to bone cancer so my youngest two siblings are in the same proverbial boat.","My parents were once vibrant, loving, and involved, just not to the extent (I would later realize) of a 'normal' family and never taught me anything practical or particularly useful. Around age 12 my father was in two car accidents that left him with chronic pain and cost him his job, after which he became an aloof and angry pill monster, abandoning any attempt to help anyone other than himself. He withdrew from family life and my mother became a shell of her former self.","I am particularly good with word craft; writing prompts, perfume reviews, fast jokes, and general wordplay. I used to be a decent musician but have years of rust to shake off, as I just can't seem to get myself motivated to play. I am often kind to a fault and later realized it made me a magnet for narcissists.","I have never had trouble making friends or ingratiating myself with new acquaintances (except for forgetting their names). Over the last few years I have had to cut several long-standing friendships out of my life when I finally realized I was being used and manipulated by narcissists. I prefer long term, monogamous romantic relationships and am now celebrating 16 years with my girlfriend.","I escaped a very abusive relationship years ago when I met my current partner. I can't help but wonder if she is still with me because she doesn't have the self esteem to try to find something better, and her family certainly doesn't approve of me, as I have nothing to offer but time and affection, but I am generally happy.","I was kicked off of Facebook for using a fake name and I don't use Instagram or Twitter or any of the like.

He received special education services and was diagnosed with mental illness in 2012. Testing is requested to assess whether Joey is receiving needed medication, therapies, and services to address his emotional, occupational, and motivational impairments. As Joey is a former foster child there is much unknown about his genetic background.","Joey was removed from his biological family when he was 3.5 y.o. He had been severely neglected (deprived of food, being held, locked in closets), sexually abused by his father and/or the father's friend. Joey has repressed these memories but was a head banger when he came into my care, his adoptive mother, at age 5.9 years. He was treated for 6 months in Unit 2, the cognitive behavior inpatient unit of Franciscan Children's Hospital. He has been on medication starting with Ritalin at the age of 6 yo. and later Bupropion. He now is treated with Abilify.","Joey has occasional and unexplained mood swings, paranoia, psychosis, grandiosity, no remorse, irritability, agitation and aggression. He is wrapped tight.",No.,"Binge eating","Joey sleeps a lot--perhaps due to boredom, lack of energy, and/or depression.","Joey has not made any strides in therapy despite years and years of it. Joey likes to work and is a social guy who likes to joke a lot, sometimes this is at odds with completing assigned tasks. He currently cleans and washes dishes at a family-owned restaurant.","Yes. His therapist is John Frechette. His psychiatrist is Dr. Andres M. Chaparro, MD. Both work at Aspire Health Alliance. Dr. Chaparro wrote the request for neuropsychological testing. 617-774-6090. Fax 617-770-3749.","Abilify, 30 mg. Propranolol, 40 mg.","Yes, episodically. Last serious incidence in July 2023 did not require hospitalization. Psychosis, paranoia, grandiosity. More recent episodes of mania observed by his daily visiting nurse who also treats diabetes brought on after 2020 psyche hospitalization and treatment with injectable Invega.","He used to be a cutter--that has subsided.","Joey loves marijuana. He has used this on and off for about 15 years. I believe the use of marijuana tripped both of his psyche hospitalizations 2012 and 2020. Joey gets very agitated and aggressive when this is discussed.","Diabetes treated with Mounjaro injected weekly 2.5/0.5. Joey also takes Amlodipine 10 mg and Metformin 500 mg. Omeprazole 20 mg. Hydroxyz Pam cap 50 mg.","Yes. Mother was mentally and intellectually disabled. Biological sister had bipolar disorder. Don't know anything about father except that he abused the mother and Joey as a child.","Joey was born prematurely. I believe 5 months and 2.5 pounds.","He did not. Joey received services for failure to thrive.","Not really. Joey likes to play cribbage. He drinks morning coffee with a friend who lives in his building.","Not since he was school age. Joey is now 39 yo. I want this testing to see what are his unmet needs as I am his only relative and approaching 70 yo.","Joey lives alone in public housing for elderly and disabled persons. He receives homemaker (2x/wk) and daily visiting nurse.","Joey had a legal problem with a neighbor who has known him since he was a child. She also has mental illness and took out a harassment restraining order on him and has made several complaints with no probable cause. Joey just ended his probation period related to charges she made against Joey--none were of a physical nature. More like calling her a bitch and giving her the finger.","Covered above.","Joey has a very strong vocabulary and an excellent sense of direction.","Yes. Joey has a dark side and is attracted to others with dark thoughts. Joey is obsessed with Vikings, I believe in part he is drawn to the aggressive and torturous mystic/history. Yet Joey internally is timid and fearful. He's never been a risk taker.","Joey had a girlfriend who did not like but nevertheless agreed to have sex with him.

My two children have been diagnosed with ADHD, my oldest with Autism Spectrum Disorder, ADHD, Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, and a non verbal learning disability.  Two of my nephews have also been diagnosed with ADHD and one nephew with Autism Spectrum Disorder.  My father has OCD tendencies, but has never been officially diagnosed.

A few years ago, there was a major fallout in my extended family that affected the relationships between us (my parents, sisters, kids, me) and my mother's side of the family.  Recently I have worried over the possibility of losing my job, as I have been placed on a Performance improvement plan.","My parents are immigrants who came from VERY humble beginnings in Mexico, to the US as very young teens looking for a way to survive and make a life for themselves.  They met here and married and worked hard to provide a stable home for my sisters and me.  I grew up very close to my family and lived in my childhood home until I moved out when I was 28 years old.  Addiction to alcohol runs on both sides of my family, though my parents stayed away from drugs/alcohol.","I am empathetic and kind.  I try to look for the best in people and strive to be helpful whenever I can.  I always look for ways to ""pay it forward"" and don't take good moments for granted.  I always try to see the humanity in others.  I am also creative and ""quirky"" though I don't know if that is a strength or quality.","Not really.  Although, I tend to isolate more nowadays than I used to.  But I have a few long-term close friendships and am very close to my sisters and a few of my cousins.","My oldest son's father and I had a very volatile relationship and a long-drawn out history. I met him when I was 16, and we became friends.  He wanted more, but I was not in a place at the time to be in a relationship with him.  We stayed friends on and off for the next 8 years, until I was going to be married to someone else.  I called off the wedding and my son's father called one day out of the blue, and we began a relationship that was in a word, explosive.  It ended with me being pregnant, him leaving the state, and me being a single mom.  He is not in my son's life to this day and that has been a great struggle.  My current relationship with my partner feels more secure and he is very present, but I often feel like he avoids emotional conversations and showing any signs of what he thinks could be seen as ""weakness""  A few years ago, I discovered that he was texting/talking to a woman that he worked with and the trust was completely broken.  We ""worked things out"" but occasionally I still feel self-conscious or like if he doesn't trust me enough to share his most intimate thoughts.  Like he doesn't want to be a burden on me or something.  I sometimes feel like he doesn't share his true self with me.","I mostly stream youtube (law commentary, spirituality, comedy, podcasts, tutorials) and audiobooks or music while I am working or performing other tasks, several hours per day.  As far as Facebook, instagram, tik tok, etc. I don't spend more than an hour or so scrolling on those per day.",no,,"I achieved a Bachelor's Degree from Devry University in 2001.  Wanted to keep going, but didn't.","I am currently feeling overwhelmed with my own mental, emotional, and physical health, but also worried that I am failing my 19 year old son (Autism Spectrum Disorder, DMDD, ADHD, NVLD) and my 9 year old who was diagnosed with ADHD last year.  We are struggling with daily functions like getting to school on time, getting to sleep, doing and completing assignments, making appointments, finding therapists and resources that they need.  I feel like I am constantly worried about what I am letting slip through the cracks and it has affected my performance at work.  As it is, it is harder for me to stay focused on my tasks at work and it takes me a long time to complete things that my manager thinks should take less time than it actually does.  I am not sure how much of this is because she doesn't understand the complexity of the reports that I am creating, or whether I am complicating the reports and falling too deep into rabbit holes that it takes me more time than it should.  My physical health is also poor.  I am currently sick with flu like symptoms and was being treated for a UTI/kidney infection last week.  I tend to get sick to my stomach, headaches, migraines, and fatigue A LOT.  I always feel like I am constantly running, exhausted, and have nothing to show for it, and am frustrated and then anxious and then just cry.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6067646892847782473/6067646892847782473_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6067646892847782473/6067646892847782473_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6067646892847782473/6067646892847782473_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6067646892847782473/6067646892847782473_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6067646892847782473/6067646892847782473_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6067646892847782473/6067646892847782473_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6067646892847782473/6067646892847782473_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6067646892847782473/6067646892847782473_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6067646892847782473/6067646892847782473_base64_75_1730955490.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6067646892847782473/6067646892847782473_base64_76_1730955490.png,,Rocio,Luna,"Aug 24, 1980","13272 Woodland Drive",,Tustin,CA,92780,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

My parents do know that it happened but I refuse to talk about it further. I’ve just blocked it out for so long, sometimes I feel like it never happened.","My mood concerns are primary my anger and irritability. I can generally regulate my other emotions. I can’t control the rage that I feel sometimes though, It’s like I lose myself entirely in it. I start shaking and I just yell and say the meanest things. I don’t like doing it but I can’t help it. I also seem to have little to no patience so I snap a lot.","When I was in kindergarten, I got injured and ended up with a concussion. Now I suffer with complicated migraines. I see a neurologist for that and she prescribed me this medication for it to take as needed. I can’t remember what it’s called right now though.","Emotional over eating","I have a hard time falling asleep because I can’t shut my brain off. It’s like my head hits the pillow and then I start thinking about my parents dying or myself and it usually makes me anxious so I end up scrolling on my phone. I usually smoke weed and play my game or scroll until I fall asleep","I’ve tried therapy and exercise.","I seen a few different therapists. I was seeing a therapist when I was in high school and middle school, her name was Lori Malakasian. She ended up moving to Florida so I stopped seeing her of course. I started seeing a therapist again around 2021 until 2023 when she moved to another practice. Her name was Stephanie Lahey","I’m not currently taking anything. Stephanie suggested medication at one point but at the time I was resistance to it.","I always say that when I’m low, I’m low and when I’m high, I’m high. I’ll go a few weeks where I’m motivated to be productive  and feeling good about life and then it’s like I crash and I lose all motivation. I don’t want to do anything and I don’t have the patience for anything or anyone.  I also struggle with visual and auditory hallucinations. Inanimate objects usually look like a being and I have to take a 2nd look to see what it actually is. Like the other day, I was pulling into my driveway and I just happened to glance at a leaf and it looked like it was the shape of a head but of course it wasn’t. Poles and road signs are people standing on the sides of the roads at first glance. Leaves tumbling across the road are small animals, and dark rooms are just dark rooms. Stephanie suggested they were anxiety induced hallucinations. I don’t hear voices in my head though besides my own. Sometimes I end up conversing with myself and it completely distracts me from the tasks I’m doing so you can say I’m easily distracted. I also hear my name being called often though usually no one’s calling it and my ear rings a lot. For a while when my mental health was really bad, I used to suffer from what I can only describe as short term amnesia. Often times I’d find myself withdrawing from a conversation in, even if I was interested in it. I could feel it starting to happen but I couldn’t stop it and then it was like I could see the person talking to me but I couldn’t hear anything that they were saying to me. I can’t tell you how long it would be before I’d snap back but I did. When I’d come through, I wouldn’t be able to remember anything that had been said to me in the last hour or anything that had been said to me before I was drawn away or during.","Like I previously stated, when I get really angry, I get the urge to hit something. I usually have to shake my hands until the urge goes away to keep me from acting on it. When I was on middle school, early high school, I used to self harm and I was suicidal. Actually because of that, my teeth are in really bad condition because I didn’t think I’d live past 18 so I didn’t care about taking care of them. I still struggle with taking care of them though.","I tend to smoke weed because it helps me feel happy and it helps me sleep. All the hallucinations I’ve experienced have been happening, even before I started to smoke weed.","I think Stephanie diagnosed me with anxiety and depression. She did suggest BPD but that was embarrassing so i just dismissed it.","My mom suffers with anxiety and depression. She takes medication for it. Apparently mental instability runs in my family according to my dad.",N/a,"I was never told I didn’t.",No.,No.,"I live with my two kids and my mom.","Not in the last three years.","Growing up was pretty tough. My mom and dad divorced when I was young but my mom was cheating on my dad. She would often bring me around him before my dad even knew and I was usually expected to lie for her, his name was Mark. Mark struggled with alcoholism and taking prescriptions that didn’t belong to him so he was very explosive. He would slam the cabinets, often breaking them and he would often threaten violence. For instance, he bought my mom a ring and in one of his outbursts, he demanded it back but when my mom refused, he said and I quote “I’ll cut your fucking finger off.” He also tried to get into my room so I felt I had to hide in the closet. He ended up breaking two of the three locks but luckily gave up before breaking the third. I ended up going to his adult son’s room that night because I felt I was in danger and my mom couldn’t protect me. My mom and I have also have had a very complicated relationship. She used to tear me down a lot and almost seemed to be jealous of me. She would often call me a slut starting when I was 15. My relationship with my dad was strained for a little because he started seeing this woman who was partially abusive. She used to throw things at me all the time when  I didn’t listen to her and when I’d defend myself, she’d call the cops on me so I stopped seeing my dad for a whole because he would always take her side. We’ve grown closer through the years though.","My best strengths
 I’d say is my resilience. I’ve been through a lot but instead of making me bitter, I’ve decided to grow from it and help others.","I have a lack of desire to initiate or maintain relationships. Besides my family, I probably really only care about like two people so I hold them close.","My partner and I are at a very good place but there was a time that he was very emotionally abusive towards me. He was a lot like my mom I’ve come to realize in my later years because we’ve been together now for about 10 years.","I use social media too much I think and I wish I wouldn’t but it’s like social media distracts me from my thoughts.","No, this is the only testing I’m expecting.","Massasoit Community college, probably class of either 2028 or 2032","I got a high school equivalency diploma and am currently trying to go for my bachelor’s for psychology. Ironic isn’t it.","I’m a very forgetful person. I often forget the points I’m  trying to make in a conversation. I also tend to forget where I put things down at so I spend most of the day looking for my phone, keys etc. I’ve actually made myself late plenty of times trying to find my phone or my purse. I also have the bad habit where I’ll put something somewhere safe and then I forget where the safe place is. I forget directions almost immediate after being told them so I usually have to ask for clarification. I also always feel like I’m in a rush and don’t know how to slow down yet I’m always late getting places.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6065721024718869198/6065721024718869198_signature_58.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6065721024718869198/6065721024718869198_signature_94.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6065721024718869198/6065721024718869198_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6065721024718869198/6065721024718869198_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6065721024718869198/6065721024718869198_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6065721024718869198/6065721024718869198_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6065721024718869198/6065721024718869198_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6065721024718869198/6065721024718869198_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6065721024718869198/6065721024718869198_base64_75_1730762904.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6065721024718869198/6065721024718869198_base64_76_1730762904.png,,Brittany,Becker,"Oct 18, 1998","2 Commercial Dr","Unit 8201",Lakeville,MA,02347,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

occupational or relational impairment","I was formally diagnosed with ADHD last week and would like to better manage/identify my symptoms so i can live productively, as well as address symptoms of MDD and GAD and avoidant attachment. 

Some of my more prevalent symptoms are overthinking, ruminating, catastrophizing, maladaptive daydreaming, procrastination/lack of motivation

I'm not sure what modality of therapy would suit me best for my needs, am open to suggestions or just picking one and seeing what fits me best.","My 5 year old brother passed away in 1999. I was only 2 years old at the time. The same year my dad got my mom arrested. The year after my mom *finally* kicked my dad out the house, haven't seen him since. Lately i've been wondering how this early childhood trauma could have implanted in me and how it could have subconsciously affected me throughout my life (avoidance, hyper-independence, emotional sensitivity).","Irritable
low mood/energy
erratic sleep schedule (sleeping late, waking late, laying in bed after wake, lack of schedule, occasional insomnia due to thinking)
lack of wanting to socialize or converse
randomly want to cry or yell but end up doing neither
exercise induced anxiety at the gym","I've hit my head 2 times that i can think of as a child (playground, hockey) that left me slightly dazed but nothing that required hospitalization or aftercare",,"erratic sleep schedule (sleeping late, waking late, laying in bed after wake, lack of schedule, occasional insomnia due to thinking)","Organizing (for ADHD): super helpful for ""organizing"" my mind

Reading articles/watching videos for self-help: helpful for gaining clarity and knowing that other people also somewhat resonate with things i go through

Reading books for leisure

Journaling thoughts: helpful for organizing individual thoughts

Turning thoughts into writing/poem: allows me to be creative and really feel my feelings as opposed to intellectualizing them","Psychiatrist: Taqialdeen Zamil, for the last 3 weeks. He actually referred me to Clarity Testing

Reached out to a number of therapists and have a session scheduled next week with Athena Dao","No, i had been hesitant about medication after receiving my MDD and AD diagnosis 2 years ago, but i am ready to start taking them.

My psych did tell me to start taking the amino acid L-theanine (200mg) for ADHD symptoms, not sure if i see any noticeable effects though...",No,"No, sometimes i feel like hitting myself but not in a harmful way",No,"Major Depressive Disorder

ADHD

No medication currently","None diagnosed, but i would imagine my father has some sort of personality disorder. He was also severe alcoholic. Also my paternal grandma claims she was abducted by aliens once, yea idk i think aliens are real but that's a stretch...

On my mother's side, none diagnosed, but my mom has been through so much (death of child, emotional/psych abuse, poverty) and there's a cultural resistance to mental health care in Japan especially among older people, so the door was just never open for that discussion or to consider that a possibility at the time these events occured.",N/A,"I don't know","basketball

weightlift

ice hockey occasionally

music (production and classical guitar) - although concentration issues are getting in the way of these","PT for a shoulder injury 4 years ago","My mother, I would like to move out though. I don't have much personal space here so it's hard to structure my life and have privacy during certain hours.","Recently no

In the past, death of sibling, father leaving/getting kicked out, moving from Oregon to California in '02","Father was severe alcoholic and would gaslight/emotionally abuse my mom, he also deserted the military and was dishonorably discharged for it. Alot of fighting and eventually he cheated on my mom, at which point my mom finally left because she was fed up, which was probably hard for her to do being an immigrant.

My mom was super supportive, sometimes too involved to the point of not respecting my wishes at the time, but she was very supportive. But since she worked alot to support me and my 2 siblings, i often felt like i had to mature quickly or discipline and raise myself. Just a symptom of our situation.

No formal diagnoses, but i suspect my dad has a personality disorder among a host of other mental health issues. My mom went through alot and has stayed strong but i can't help but think there has to be some long term effect(s) of her situation. All speculation though","Sensitive, compassionate, empathetic, understanding, resilient, sensible, helpful","I do have trouble initiating relationships. I get anxious and start to think they might not like me as much as i like them, whether that be platonic or romantic relationships. I want to be less avoidant and anxious in these scenarios and be able to express how i feel without ruminating on any potential perceived negative

No drama though, i get along with others really well and don't really mingle with those who aren't similar in that regard.","Similar to above, I have always been avoidant + anxious in the early stages due to lack of certainty or anxiety to the point where it almost becomes like a self-fulfilling prophecy. I don't want to be like that anymore, but also lately I'm scared to start over with someone new. I feel like i don't have it in me because breakups are hard/really emotional for me. It's hard balancing these two feelings","2-3 hours between instagram and tiktok and youtube",No,n/a,"In k-12, teachers thought i was disruptive or an issue bcuz i would joke around alot or mutter under my breath (singing, talking to myself)

In college, i had alot of trouble carving out study time and concentrating on studying. I recently was diagnosed with ADHD, so my lack of focus on studying/research or dozing off in lecture makes alot of sense now. 

At one point i had to talk to the Dean of Sciences because they threatened to withhold my financial aid, and i was shaking crying in her office while all she told me was to ""pick myself up by my bootstraps"" which was really invalidating...

But I got my Bachelor of Science in Astronomy with a Math minor, but i still have stress dreams that i didn't finish school because the last 2 years was such a stressful and confusing time in my life.",,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6055296147715293575/6055296147715293575_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6055296147715293575/6055296147715293575_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6055296147715293575/6055296147715293575_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6055296147715293575/6055296147715293575_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6055296147715293575/6055296147715293575_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6055296147715293575/6055296147715293575_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6055296147715293575/6055296147715293575_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6055296147715293575/6055296147715293575_base64_75_1729720415.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6055296147715293575/6055296147715293575_base64_76_1729720416.png,,Waylon,Holt,"Jan 13, 1997","12152 Chapman Ave",23,"Garden Grove",Ca,92840,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

I think my inability to complete what I need to during the day occupies all of my thoughts at night. Adding to that, my exhaustion makes my inability to focus even worse.","No, I do not have nightmares/flashbacks.","I get extremely depressed about my inability to get anything done and shut down/isolate myself from others.  I am also very quick to anger and have a hard time calming down.",No.,"Emotional over eating","I have a horrible insomnia that is slowly ruining my mental state. Melatonin does nothing and I take Trazodone to sedate myself.","Aside from medication, I do yoga, hiking, reading books, and other things. Therapy is hard for me as I am a very closed off person and tend to process my emotions on my own/in my journal.","I was diagnosed with ADHD at the end of Elementary school and saw that psychiatrist until high school when I went off my meds due to my desire to “not rely on meds”. I can no longer avoid the use of medication. I have no record of their name as this was over ten years ago/when I was a minor.","I take Wellbutrin which somewhat helps my negative ideations, but it does not help me focus at all.","Nothing more than heightened anxiety/depression.","No. Just a feeling of not wanting to do anything.",No.,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger and took Ritalin first then Concerta. The concerta was much better for me. Ritalin was bad. 

I also take Trazodone for insomnia, and Wellbutrin for depression.","My father’s side has a pattern of ADHD and depression.",No.,"Does not apply.","Writing is my primary hobby.",No.,"I live with a roommate in a two bedroom apartment.",No.,"I have amazing parents but my sister is manic Bipolar and has been my entire life. My father’s side also has a long history of drug abuse/mental health issues. My dad is very ADHD, but does not get depressed or anything.","I try my best to be kind to others and live my life honestly. My friends and family would probably say I am smart/funny.","My platonic friendships are great. 

I have issues with intimate relationships though and tend to get bored of my partners or push them away. I have had several issues with infidelity.","I am very hypersexual and tend to care more about the physical than the emotional which has ruined most of my relationships.","According to my phone, about six.","Other than defending my thesis in May, no.","University of Massachusetts Boston","I have struggled and struggled through my entire educational life, somehow managing to get to a masters program. I will say however none of it was easy. I constantly struggle to meet deadlines, read (especially impossible), and produce any work. I am completely immobilized like I have an inability to start things. I am fortunate that I study writing, in another field I never would have gotten my degree without medication. I am immensely concerned that I will not finish my thesis in time.","I am very scatter-brained and sometimes socially awkward.

My mother definitely has some form of OCD or extreme anxiety alongside with depression undiagnosed. 

My stepfather had substance abuse and alcohol problems. It was very abusive so I can imagine his mental health history is not perfect.

A while back, I decided to get medical help for my anxiety and was prescribed Zoloft. I stayed on it for about two years before stopping. I only recently started seeking help for my ADHD. At the beginning of this year, I began treatment and was first put on Ritalin and Concerta, but they didn't really work for me. So, I was quickly switched to Adderall.

While taking Adderall, I had severe anxiety, irritation, and heart palpitations, though not every day and the affects of adderall did not seem to help anymore. I eventually told my primary care doctor about these side effects, and they suggested I stop the medication until I could see a psychiatrist to check for any underlying issues that might mimic ADHD.

I had an appointment with a psychiatrist at LifeStance Health California. They recommended that to help me better, I should see a neuropsychologist because of my history with anxiety and ADHD, which includes:

Severe social anxiety where I believe everyone around me (especially in professional settings) thinks negatively of me

Have a hard time listening when others talk and tend to interrupt or space out. Had been previously diagnosed at MGH in Boston at age 5, but had never taken medication nor had undergone more than a few sessions of therapy here or there until later adulthood.","Not that I'm aware of.",,"Sleep is tough, usually try binaural beats but it's hard to fall asleep, usually get about 5 hours a night (in bed at or past midnight, up at 5am as my son gets up for school early).","Self help books, prior and current therapy sessions, exercise, morning guided meditation, weekly Mass. Current therapy helps with dealing with issues but even with mental exercises have a really tough time staying focused, or cleaning the house or being attuned to what I'm working on or what others are saying/doing.","Yes, previously saw Byron Cargill (saw him for about 4 years until about a year ago, more dealing with past divorce and issues surrounding that). Currently have been seeing Katelyn Jackson about 3-4 months now, working towards dealing with childhood issues with how I was raised, current and past fallout with family members, learning to be in a relationship (I have a steady girlfriend for about 3.5 years now but there are times she gets disappointed when I forget to do things or complete them).","Haven't tried anything.

Was divorced about 8 years ago (didn't want the divorce, my ex-wife did). Have a girlfriend now the past 3.5 years, we don't live together but would like to (housing costs are astronomical).","Moved when parents divorced when I was 8. Weekends and summers with my father on Cape Cod and my mother in New Bedford. Dad was nice guy but emotionally distant, my stepmother who was in the picture since I was 9 was very overbearing and drank a lot (also enabled my father to drink and smoke a lot). They have both passed from lung cancer back in 2010 and 2018. My mom had a same sex relationship starting in late 1970s, making it hard to have friends over when we all lived in the same house, and her partners daughters who were also gay tended to look down upon males, and made that vocally known to me and my younger brother.  A later partner of my mom's when I was 14 and having to move to Iowa at the same time, she didn't know how to deal with children so point of contention there as well, which remained with us somewhat until my mother died. Have not talked with my older sisters or younger brother since mom's death as I felt the funeral and grief were all revolved around my mom's partner and I was not allowed to come out as selfish when trying to talk about mine. No known mental or behavioral diagnoses on any of my family members that I know of.","People say I am very kind and loyal, and I have a good grasp of gratitude and living in the moment, that I value family and my son and girlfriend greatly.","I tend to withdraw and be alone sometimes but I also like to be social but more in group gatherings not so much 1:1.","I have a hard time expressing my feelings or negativity to partners present and past, feeling like doing so will cause them to leave me. Have a tendency to act like everything is great but underneath constantly nervous or feeling like I always have to entertain or be 'on'.","3-4 hours, Facebook Instagram TikTok youtube.

occupational or relational impairment","Truthfully, I will be willing to try most types of therapy, skill building and informational wealth building to understand more about my struggles with motivation, fidgeting and procrastination. It's difficult to keep up with multi-step work plans, remember to schedule appointments or meeting, creating outlines for every little meeting is my enemy, its exhausting to have more than two meetings in one day, and to have to take care of myself as an adult after from chores, to making food, to homework for school and putting energy into my friendships and relationships can be hard sometimes.","Yes, I experienced moderate to serve childhood abuse due to my mothers emotional, psychological and physical abuse. I was majorly housed and fed but experienced food insecurity, gas/lights shut off constantly and section 8 housing inspections. My older brother was severely disabled and often had violent outbursts so my stuff was often broken, he was often being restrained violently by family members and he often hit me. 

I am mixed and My father and his side of the family wasn't around, so i was with my mothers side (the white side) and often experienced racism from her family for being mixed and not looking white, I also experienced sexual abuse from my grandfather and my mothers boyfriend. 

I have trust issues, PSTD, flashbacks, nightmares, revenge daydreams (nothings ever put to action, it's just helpful to think about being the hero and saving myself sometimes), struggles with relationships, intimacy, holiday time, self esteem, self worth, dissociation, etc. While I've been in therapy for years, it's still difficult as after i was kicked out at 17, I experienced several more traumatic incidents that were ongoing until the last few year.","Paranoia, constantly, anxiety, constantly, irritable, stressed out, depersonalization, not being able to leave the bed for hours, crying over having to perform simple tasks, deep frustration when it comes to anything numerical. I've experienced depression for as long as i can remember and haven't been able to see myself getting to high points of happiness, while I'm safer/having amazing family around me, i do feel like there's a little cloud that changes in shape and aggression (think storming) depending on the day","I dont think i've have had one, nor remember ever getting envaulted for it.","Anorexia Nervosa
Picky eater","Ive been on trazodone and high strength melatonin for a long time, i use headspace, white noise, comfort tv shows and have my bed in a very particular way to sleep but im constantly paranoid of being harmed + i have chronic pain in my shoulders, upper back and neck so sleep is VERY difficult to obtain and when i do, i oversleep. My schedules always been hard to maintain, i've never been a morning person or had a consistent schedule or sleep aids.","dozens of self help books and apps, I have a lot of difficultly taking pills daily so my vitamin regime is not great, meditation (too difficult, my brain is anxious and wander), medication, inpatient, out patient, day patient care, minimal ED recovery centers due to insurance and time, music, fidget toys, special pillows to craddle the head, CBT, DBT, talk therapy, art therapy","I'm currently looking for a therapist who is queer and/or trans and/or bipoc who understands severe childhood trauma as i aged out of the program that housed my last therapist. 

My current PCP is Raedjio Naro, im looking for a psychiatrist","seterinlin, Prozac, trazodone: all under 100mg daily but again, it was extremely difficult for me to remember to take a pill everyday and if i kept on it for say 2-3 weeks and fell off from one day, the side effects were intense. i dont have much to say to this, i've just given up on meds despite not having trying many because im tired of my emotions being out of wack due to my inability to take them daily. I've tried reminders, carrying the bottle around with me, leaving them by the front door, keys, on the bathroom sink, etc, and i just cant do it.","i struggle with lack of self care: hygiene, eating, drinking water, hobbies, communication, feeling during major depressive episodes, i struggle with depersonalization disorder and feel detached from myself and struggle to see my body as mine sometimes or feel unsettled when seeing myself in the mirror if i try to focus on who i am, or who is in the mirror.","i used too self harm with sharp objects on my body, not eating, pinching, hitting and attempted several times as a teenager and young adult, now i do not engage in those behaviors but have ideation often and consider sometimes the lack of self care as self harm.","i would say I'm dependent on weed, it helps my sleep, eating and engaging with friends but some strains just make my symptoms worse and i know if i was asked to quit now or lower it, it would be frustrating and difficut.","Therapy wise: depression, pstd, depersonalization disorder, autism, anxiety, paranoia

im currently on no medications 

i have no psychiatrist atm due to a insurance change","i dont know, my mother did not speak about her mental health and my father wasn't around but i suspect they both dealt with things.",n/a,"im not sure, but my vision was impaired young as i started crawling into things.","I read, do book clubs occasionally. I play video games and play with friends and go to events, i build lego sets, watch tv, camp sometimes, enjoy lgbt events, etc.","Physical therapist yes","Three roommates, my two cats in a severely overpriced apartment in the city.","what happens to my roommates effects me as we all live together, so yes 

but also, we just got priced out of our former apartment and all had to move, and half of us had covid during it and were very sick, and the apartment had a ton of problems upon moving in","my dad wasn't around, my older brother was severely disabled/autistic and lashed out violently often and i was attacked a lot, my mother was hostile, abusive emotionally and physically and often did nothing about my brother breaking things, or hurting me, she dated a lot of men who struggled with substances and i often believe she did too. my grandmother enabled her, and my grandfather/two of her boyfriends made sexual advances on me as a child/teen, i never told any family, it wasn't worth it. i lived in section 8 housing, routine checks and often had to talk to DCF as they were called on us often, i have one younger brother, we're 11 years apart, my older brother left when he was about two so he was kind of sparred of having to grow up with my older brother.  i was often alone, taking care of myself, fearful of asking of help, constantly on edge, struggled with food, confidence, self harm, being constantly berated, fought with, insulted, blamed, etc.","I had to ask my partner, I'm not good at these questions, he wrote them down below - 
- research
- analytic skills 
- reading
- writing (like short stories)
- good at public speaking (including planning a speech/workshop)
- inclusive to all, always reaching out to those who need help
- organizing
- great with collaborative leadership
- great listener
- remembers details others usually don't see/know
- dedicated mentality
- resilient (""yes, believe it or not you are"")","I had/have difficult maintaining relationships for a long time due to not understanding what healthily relationships and communication and boundary setting looked like and i have many insecure feelings and trust issues that i often have to work through as triggers are something I deal with a lot and I'm a terrible people pleaser and attempt to keep the peace a lot. i don't have any desire to make any new friends or romantic relationships, what i have is enough and takes a lot of work to maintain and i cant imagine adding more.","I have a fear of being left, being physically/emotionally/sexually abused, being misunderstood, I'm hyper independent and have trust issues about being helped because I've taken care of myself for so long. I have a lot of struggles with sex and intimacy due to triggers of past assaults. I am non-monogamous and have two romantic partners, who are kind and supportive but we're all working on things from our childhood so it can be hard sometimes when our traumas hit against each other.","i know i have a internet addiction, its all i had as a kid going through what i did and i average 12-14 hours a day between discord, Instagram, Facebook, moblie games and id love to lower that, seriously.","no, all other places dont accept my insurance or would charge me several thousand dollars, or the waitlist is years long.","BunkerHill Community College","i had to do night school during my senior year as i couldn't pass a math class due to the dyscalculia, my family and the school never took action. Now i cant get through my math classes to get my associate degree, it's taken years to get through two classes. it's important for me to get this diagnosis for my autism and dyscalculia to further my education with accommodations, and if anything else pops up, getting care for it because life is just hard dealing with it all.","its important that the person who helps me is anti-racist, an ally/competent in care of trans and queer people, and someone whos aware of severe childhood trauma, i probably didn't write everything down because i've blocked it out. thanks for reading",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6042327683946298899/6042327683946298899_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6042327683946298899/6042327683946298899_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6042327683946298899/6042327683946298899_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6042327683946298899/6042327683946298899_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6042327683946298899/6042327683946298899_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6042327683946298899/6042327683946298899_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6042327683946298899/6042327683946298899_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6042327683946298899/6042327683946298899_base64_75_1728423570.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6042327683946298899/6042327683946298899_base64_76_1728423570.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

We have a lot of communication problems that is usually my job to sort out as the eldest child, but are otherwise very supportive. I do feel like we have autism and/or adhd in the family, but my parents haven't sought out a diagnosis. My younger sister (21) independently sought out testing in adulthood. 

My paternal grandfather committed suicide, and my paternal grandmother takes medication for depression. My paternal uncle also hasn't sought a diagnosis but displays a lot of classic autistic behavior, as does my dad but he is more high functioning.","Very attentive, I can get high quality work done and fast, I am a very quick learner.","I maintain very strong friendships with a small group of people. I generally don't mind initiating friendships but do find it difficult to develop new lasting ones rather than friendly acquaintanceships.","I don't do a lot of dating because my anxiety makes it difficult to get out of the house.

I've constantly had issues with schooling. Elementary and Middle School I was in gifted programs, but in high school I struggled to keep up with homework and projects and failed a lot of classes, or scraped by with very good test scores, but very bad everything else. I slept through a lot of my classes as well. 
I improved a little in college, but still struggled a lot to keep up with homework and course work, but regularly did very well in tests. Some classes which I found very engaging either because of the professor or classmates I aced, but other times even if I was very passionate about the subject, I still struggled to complete a lot of the assignments. 
I attempted to take online courses which were immediate fails. I intended to do a lot more schooling, and double majoring in other subjects that I really loved, but I stopped because of how much struggle I had.","After college, I also struggled very much to find a job, partially because there's a lot of fake job offers in the art industry and also because my anxiety was so bad I couldn't get through interviews and would burn myself out off worry. Attempting to be self employed only highlighted my struggles to complete multi-step tasks, since it meant I had to manage so many other things. Combined with my regular struggle with schooling, I'm worried that I might not be able to hold down a job with these hurdles at all.

I've also been feeling like my short-term memory has worsened significantly.","I have had several people in my life commit suicide, while I don't have flashbacks, nightmares, or any plans to do the same, I think the discombobulation of experiencing that kind of death several times still affects me, and my quickness to feeling overwhelmed.","I do feel like I've been sleeping more than I should, and I tend to feel very easily overwhelmed, in which my first response is to freeze and then escape. I think I times I have dealt with mood swings in which I feel extremes of feeling totally fine in my life and my pursuits, and suddenly panic, feeling incompetent, unable to face the responsibilities I've signed myself up for, and extreme worry about the state of my relationships and my ability to function.",No,,"I don't tend to have trouble sleeping, but I do often smoke marijuana before going to bed. I've been more concerned with over sleeping, as my energy level throughout the day can really plummet despite getting 8 or more hours of sleep.","I currently have a therapist and take 40mg of Prozac daily. This has been effective in stabilizing me for the past 4 years approximately, however, I think its overall effectiveness has diminished, I've come across new issues of focus and feeling scattered as I've entered my late 20s, and while I'm stable, I wouldn't say my quality of life, mood, or ability to function fully is ideal, and I worry about it worsening.","I've been seeing my Therapist Kacie Biddle since August 2021, though I've been without a psychiatrist for some time due to changing health insurance a few times.  I currently have an appointment with a psychiatrist from Life Changes Group this coming Wednesday (10/2) and they are aware I am seeking out psychological testing.","I am currently taking Prozac, and while it's been working in a lot of ways, I worry I suffer from fatigue from it quiet a bit. 

During the pandemic, while psychiatrists were in shortage, my primary care at the time notified some issues I was dealing with typical of ADHD (that doctor having it herself) and prescribed me Vyvanse. I did feel many positive effects on my executive function in focus early on, but I also felt overtime issues with anxiety, feelings of being overwhelmed, and freeze responses to stress increasing. I think there is potential for it to still work for me despite some of these side effects, especially paired with a new anti-depressant

At one point I was prescribed Wellbutrin, but had awful side effects of increased anger, hair falling out, trouble sleeping, and even some liver issues, so it doesn't seem like a vial treatment option for me.","I don't believe so, though at times maybe minor forms of paranoia and ideas of reference when interpreting folks perception of me.","Luckily no, I'm trying to care for myself while ahead.","I definitely have a problematic marijuana habit and use it to self-medicate and numb some of my feelings/anxieties regularly. I think overall I struggle a little bit with impulse control and can have aspects of an addictive personality, though luckily not to very destructive things. I'd say I have impulse control around the internet, playing video games and aspects of dark patterns they utilize, and marijuana. However, never have I struggled with addiction to substances like alcohol or cigarettes.",No,"My parents were not big advocates of psychiatry and therapy growing up, so while I have no official diagnosis I can track, it appears to me that my parents have also struggled with ADHD, Depression, and possible Bipolar disorder on my mom's side.",n/a,"Yes, for the most part, a little late on reading, and while my parents suspected I might have dyslexia, they thought it better I didn't get diagnosed for some reason.","I have many old friends who are passionate about video games and we keep in touch online through that medium. 

I regularly attend and participate in poetry open mic and slam poetry in the Boston area. In some ways, its become my work, as I teach creative writing classes to teens and adults. the art form provides lots of community that I'm very grateful for.","I have had minor physical therapy on an issue I was having with my knee.","I live in a cozy apartment with a loving partner, a cat, and a very needy, anxious dog.","I've returned to grad school this semester after more than 4 years away from the academic setting. In some ways, I feel like the issues I'm dealing with in my personal well-being mirror the kind of issues I was dealing with in undergrad.","My mother, who I still believe did her best, was often verbally abusive (called me useless a lot as a child) and had occasional moments of physical abuse, though without any extreme bodily harm. 

My parents also didn't do much to structure my extracurricular time, and I think there were major periods of my development where I'd spend hours on my computer, passing my own time.

I don't have many suicides in the family or struggles with addiction in recent generations, though I have heard some of those cases occur in more extended family, and further back in my family history.","I think I'm very self-aware, introspective, gentle, friendly, accommodating, able to think on my feet, caring, and creative. I've seen some success in my artistic career as a poet, and I find that art form very central to my identity in a way that I am proud of.","I think not to any extreme degree, though I do feel I've become more recluse in the past year or so, and I do have a tendency to disappear on my friends and loved ones usually out of fear of/freeze of responding to them.","I am polyamorous, and while I've had a majoritively healthy experience in that mode of dating, I did have a very serious break up about a year ago with a partner who had unprotected sex with someone new without my knowledge. Despite my commitment to further wanting to work and recover in our relationship, that person continued to create ways that felt like healing our relationship was unfeasible for my well-being. I think while going through this I did struggle myself with emotional regulation and didn't always respond in the most healthy manner either. I think under duress, I can be meaner than I realize or feel justified in being mean when I've been wronged. However, that's only come up in already destabilized situations, and don't regularly express myself in my relationships. I think my trust and worry about how I'm perceived and weather I feel wanted around are still effected.","I primarily use Instagram and YouTube. I've been watching YouTube since I was very young, it filled a lot of my unstructured time and have at times binged it for the majority of the day. Its often the platform I escape to when dealing with freeze responses or struggling with executive function.","No testing, but an upcoming psychiatric intake, however, this testing is mainly for complimenting that pursuit.","Tufts University Graduate Program, 2026","More than ever I've noticed trouble focusing, feeling present or caught up in class, losing my train of thought while in discussion, and creating structures outside of class that support my learning. I think most of my academic issues are internal and don't present themselves in a disrupting way to my educators, but at times it has felt like a masking of sort of my dysfunction.",,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6031959795314609159/6031959795314609159_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6031959795314609159/6031959795314609159_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6031959795314609159/6031959795314609159_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6031959795314609159/6031959795314609159_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6031959795314609159/6031959795314609159_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6031959795314609159/6031959795314609159_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6031959795314609159/6031959795314609159_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6031959795314609159/6031959795314609159_base64_75_1727386780.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6031959795314609159/6031959795314609159_base64_76_1727386781.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

I'm in a management role that I recently started, i've managed teams for years - the act of just sending a very standard email feels overwhelming. I feel not good enough. I also feel worried about my memory and (what feels like) cognitive impairment/decline in more recent months, as i'm honestly having trouble in every single aspect of my life and feel completely stuck, i'm just barely getting through the motions and the little energy i get to complete the bare minimum tasks is the thought of my two perfect little kiddos!! They deserve the best version of me and it's becoming more difficult to suppress these symptoms that i've never directly faced or dealth with.","Yes, In 2017, my dad was killed as he was pulling into his driveway on a sunday afternoon by a police officer driving 93mph and texting. As his only child and since he was single, I was his next of kin that should've been immediately notified. Instead of the proper procedure, I was not notified of my dad's passing until 7 hours later through the media, all over the news, where I saw a picture of my dad and my daughter, his first grandchild (She was only five months old at the time, 2017) that was taken directly from my facebook and surface on the internet. The horrific acts of the police dept. and others following my dad's death were horrible and in turn, i think i learned (unintentionally) to dissociate.   when my phone was ringing off the hook and (i had a new baby, my dad's first grandchild), since I had been occupied with my new baby, i hadn't had my phone on me very  after my mom called the police station to request formal notification (it didn't seem real).  Following my dad's death, there was so much trauma that it began to show up as physical symptoms such as extreme numbness and tingling in my hands & forearms - with a 5 month old baby, grieving and trying to adjust to life as a new family of 3 all at once,  i was desperate for a doctor but it was during the pandemic - i found a rheumatologist & very long story short, among other wrongdoings and manipulation, he sexually assaulted me from 2021 to this past Spring of 2023. I was the first patient to speak out, as I contacted the medical board directly. Dr. Todd told me in nearly every single appt. that the medical symptom was just like the justice system, they always protected their own and you had no chance and shouldn't bother to even fight against them (he'd always relate it to how unfortunate it was that i didn't already know this before ""wasting"" so much money fighting against the police for my dad's justice when i never stood  chance). With this in mind, I was so nervous to report him, i went through a very hard time in the months leading up to when i told the board of medicine... once i reported him, 208 other victim's of Dr. Todd's came forward that they were victims of Dr. Todd too. I am very easily triggered by any circumstance or idea, etc. that feels uncertain or unknown to me. I also suffer from avoidance, as I avoid the entire area of where my dad's accident was and where he's buried, it hurts me too much. Also, ievery time i talk about the abuse or my dad, i cannot help but cry and it feels like all of the built up emotions from Dr. Todd & my dad's death are coming out at once. I'm also suffering from what i believe to be auto-immune systems as a result as well. I've been to several dermatologists, as i've never suffered w/ acne in my life and my face continues to go through periods where it'll break out in cystic acne. I also have been suffering from insomnia that certainly worsens all of the other symptoms it seems.","Extreme memory concerns and loss (both past & present), cognitive decline (showing up at work and presenting alot of issues for me), Isolating, extreme irritability & low patience, excessively tearful to the point it's impacting my day because i'm easily triggered by any story that has an element of emotion or even if i see someone do something kind for someone. I feel extreme worry - whenever I hear a cry outside (we have tons of kids in our neighborhood) by anyone (even if i can tell it's clearly a ""fun"" yell/scream or it's not my child, etc.), my body and mind go into full panic.","Concussions as a result of two car accidents. One was confirmed but the other one i am also certain of, i just cannot remember if the medical records confirmed it. I never had MRI's and both car accidents were when I was in college - 2008 and the worst one, where i had definite TBI, was in 2011.",,"my sleeping is all over the place, every night is different. I seem to go through phases every month where I have periods of insomnia and trouble falling asleep. I occasionally take a clonazepam (1mg, prescribed on an as needed basis) to fall asleep when my anxiety and worry keep me awake.","I've tried countless self-help books, self-help podcast, yoga, hot yoga, HIIT exercise, meditation, EMDR, Talk Therapy, Spiritual Medium. 

They were all slightly effective in their own ways and to utilize as a tool to manage but at the end of the day, it's hard to use tools when you feel frozen or like they're unavailable.","Yes, both - currently, I am only seeing a Psychiatrist, Heather Connors, RN, MSN, PMHNP-BC is her title, who i've been seeing for over at least a year now. I see her 1x on a monthly basis for 30 minutes. She is my prescriber. Also, i've had several therapists (through the pandemic, many kept leaving or ""taking breaks"" and providers were inconsistent). My most recent therapist said she wasn't trauma informed and preferred i utilize a more trauma-informed therapist.","Zoloft, 1x per day, 75mg (taken in morning)
Clonazepam (1-2x per day, as needed - only taken occasionally, several days throughout week at most).","No, never.","No, never.","No, never.","ADHD (Adderall, 20mg 3x per day) - ANXIETY, DEPRESSION & PTSD (clonazepam 1mg, 2x per day as needed & Zoloft, 75mg 1x per day)","adhd on my maternal side","High blood pressure concerns, i had two c-sections for both of my children as a result of the concern.

When I think about how opposite my ""true"" personality is/had always been growing up throughchildhood and even college, the person i'm describing couldn't be more polar opposite so it's also impacting my confidence, self-esteem and feeling of uncertainty in who i am.

However, I now I've was technology seeing two therapist (due to one of them talking leave for a bit) the main therapist that I see is Sarah Botieri and later on I was seeing a therapist named Katie (they both work at Guiding Light consoling in Pembroke, MA). Long story short I've been at guiding light for roughly a year now. I've also been seeing a psychiatrist named Dr. Pedro Bonilla, who I've been seeing once every 3 mouths for about 6 mouths (so 2 visits so far).","escitalopham, and Prophanolol","maybe some paranoia, mania for sure but it's been dying down for the last 9 mouths (and I having trouble dealing with it when I was 22), I'm honestly not to sure about grandiosity (however, bipolar behavior does run in my family, so it wouldn't hurt to figure out). and a little bit of ideas of reference from time, I worry about the outside world too much, however those thoughts are starting to fade overtime.",No.,"I smoke marijuana, actually it help me get me more out of psychosis. because there were days where I was having trouble getting out of bed, taking care of myself, and then going outside.

I mostly live with my Dad and step mom, but we've been distant from each other.","In the last year I had an emotional reaction that cost me my job at a machine shop in Rockland, and I've just been doing my best to move past the emotions of making such a mistake.","My biological mom was very controlling in the house hold, and she sent me to school far away from my family and friends, which meant I moved a lot and had little social interaction with my family because I felt so distant with them. My parents also go divorced when I was in high school, and my mother at one point managed to get my dad arrested under a false charge.

I am ambitious with Mensan IQ, but I feel frozen/overwhelmed when I need to take action. I started Buspirone 1.5 years ago, and that has been a life changer (3x per day). I was prescribed sertraline 100 nightly for a long time which made it worse, but I'm still on 75 sertraline nightly and I wonder if I should be? I like Time Management games from BigFish Games, and it's odd how it can keep me occupied/distracted. In late teens and early twenties I'd consume lots of caffeine and Mint Milano Pepperidge Farm cookies at work, then crash after work and try to keep going with ginger ale, but I've never been positive for diabetes. I spent a lot of my teens and twenties laying in bed. I have started Line Dancing lessons, and her verbal instructions confuse me so I practice with videos and no audio.","Early neglect ( my mother never and I mean never told me she loved me or hugged me), revictimization as adult because I didn't know better and hadn't been warned. I was in two car accidents as adult where a stranger T boned the vehicle I was driving and I was knocked out. I've fainted on a tile floor....

I am an empath and am nurturing and love being a mother. My parents and 2 siblings are narcissists. Neither of my 2 sisters has had children. My mother never should have had children. my father wanted kids, but I think it was to rework his own childhood ( my mother was just like his mother). I would like to have a healthy and happy marriage and family life. I would like to be nonavoidant and have a satisfying job. Go back to school, even....

I have a lot of negative memories, and I am having more memories and realizations (daily) now that I have Buspirone. With my very high IQ (Mensa) and Buspirone and a LIFETIME of never giving up, and now some new neutral memories from high school, I am making progress. I am a survivor! And people have told me I have profoundly improved their lives ( I wanted to be a psychologist and use this talent, but I haven't been able to). I hope to live another 40 years, at least. I have SO much to offer.","I used to not be able to get out of bed and isolate a lot ( but giving birth 13 years ago has kept me out of bed) . I've had decades to learn to mask and learn social skills and buspirone has helped me. Irritability sometimes and it was worse when on Sertraline 100 ( from primary care physicians). I've had paralyzing anxiety so bad I couldn't fire my divorce attorney and hire a new one. It was just too much to think about....****My eye contact with people is a conscious act.****

I have started experiencing loneliness sometimes, which is a sign of improvement I think. Becoming more active in Mensa, Buspirone, Crappy Childhood Fairy on YouTube, etc. have helped. But I need friends My Age and people LIKE ME, and that's hard in a bedroom community. Especially being me.","Yes. 2 car crashes where I was driving a vehicle and a man T boned me. Knocked out both times. I assume I had at least one concussion from that. Fainted on a tile floor. Did some headers playing soccer, but I was already a depressed child. Quiet with good grades. There may have been a couple other times of unconsciousness or concussion. I had a bike crash in elementary school that knocked me out. It just popped into my head....

I have had MRIs and CAT scans from my neck down on various areas due to car crashes and psoriatic arthritis, but I don't remember if I've had an MRI of my brain. **** I may have had some oxygen deprivation during birth. It was 1962, and the nurse was telling my mother to stop pushing because the doctor was coming. The doctor could be heard running down the hall yelling,"" I'm coming, Karen!"" My mother was saying she couldn't stop pushing. Big chaos.****",,"I keep fall a pen and paper by my bed, but I fall asleep fine. I wake up once during the night to use the restroom. When I had bad anxiety, I had a pill that I could take. I only took one every few months if it was a very anxiety filled night....

I have never smoked a joint or done cocaine or narcotics. I do not use opioids, despite my Psoriatic Arthritis. Diet Coke daily and caffeine free Diet Coke at night. A glass of Prosecco with dinner half the days of the week.","I tried a psychologist for a few sessions in high school. She was clueless. I went to the student health center in college just once to speak to a guy, and he mocked me because I said I really had no friends despite it being a school with 50,000 students. My IQ is one in 50,000, roughly. I have tried self help books, a daily vitamin, exercise doesn't work right now but a fast bike ride in high school helped. Medication seems worthwhile but lonely, and I like to get up and leave my apartment. Pilates doesn't work for me because I am staring at the ceiling with auditory commands and no visual cues. I converted from Christianity to Judaism 20 years ago, but my ex husband ( a Jew) refused to join a synagogue. I wish I could just throw on some clothes and go to synagogue. I tried a therapist in the 1990s who said I had PTSD, but she had problems of her own and she didn't help me.","See above. Currently I see Kim Quickel, MFT on an as needed basis. She sent me to Progeny Psychiatric Clinic 1.5 years ago, and Hilary Breedon, PMHNP-BC changed my life by prescribing Buspirone. They swabbed my cheek and the results were that Buspirone was indeed probably a good choice for me and also that my body might have trouble processing B vitamins and Iron and vitamin D. So I have methylated B plus methylated Iron in one supplement. Vitamin D in another supplement. I take each of these supplements about every three days. I take a multivitamin almost daily.","See above.
Presently, Sertraline 75 nightly, Buspirone 3x daily, atorvastatin, nightly, Taltz biologic injectable once every 4 weeks. Lots of daytime caffeine.**** I think the Sertraline 100 nightly I mention above made me worse. ****","Possible hypomania a few times where I felt cheerful and had more to say, but no running around and buying things and feeling grandiose. I just felt happy and more normal. I had one episode of such severe anxiety in the 1990s where I just couldn't function and I could have ended up on the street and I had a day where I wondered if my ex was spying on me. I called a hotline, but he had no advice. I was living in Texas, a medical and mental healthcare desert, with no car and no family support as the targeted child. Sucked.","I've been so depressed my brain felt pain. I think that was the 1990s. Don't tell me the brain doesn't feel pain. Where no one was helping me despite my best efforts. But I just decided I'd never kill myself no matter what. I'm a warrior. I will never give up. And I am a mother so I can't leave. :)","Caffeine during the day and I remind myself to drink water.","Psoriatic arthritis. Taltz 8 mg every 4 weeks. Diclofenac rarely for arthritis pain.
Anxiety, Buspirone 10 mg 3 times a day.
My left leg is a quarter inch shorter than my right leg, and I just found that out last December 2023, roughly, and I have orthotics. Orthotics are amazing!","My mother's side of the family. Just strange. Depression, anxiety, codependency, narcissism. Covert narcissism in my mother and her father. Codependency in my mother's parents. (Generational trauma is real.) My father married a replicant of his mother. It just repeats, UNTIL NOW. I broke that pattern and the resistance has been huge. My father seems to have been a narcissist as well as my 2 siblings. There was a silent treatment habit among some and just not communication or physical affection or self awareness in some. My father's 2 siblings had problems in some areas. I am SO happy my sisters didn't have children. And I am distressed that various relatives and cousins did have kids.","Possible oxygen deprivation during my birth.
When I gave birth it was an ""emergency"" C section. I have thoughts about that.","I think I did.","Mensa, Line Dancing.","About 2003, I had a cat bite on my finger. When I got out of the hospital after surgery, I saw a finger therapist.","I have my son half the time. In reality, we spend most of the time at my son's father's house. My ex had a stroke two years ago. He is also a narcissist. He didn't like the supposed side effects of his blood pressure medication, stopped taking it, and had a big stroke. So, we keep an eye on him. My son is NOT a narcissist.","My first two husbands are dead. My first was about three years and from another culture and we divorced. My second was very brief as he was alcoholic, etc. My third lasted 12 years until I couldn't stand it anymore. We separated in Fall 2016 and divorced.","Drugs and suicide weren't evident. Depression and narcissism are very evident. We moved when I was 2, 4, 7, 12. Moved to college at 17.","I care. I am genuinely happy for other people, not jealous. I can be very perceptive and I am blazingly intelligent. I learn easily and have huge potential. If I wasn't a genius empath with some issues, this life would have been so much less painful.","I converse easily when I enter a group of like people. Mensa gatherings are easy. If there is a commonality, I do ok. I was paralyzed to speak in front of my sixth grade class, but now I can speak in front of crowds. I can be very charming. But I don't just randomly initiate relationships. I never call some one up to meet for coffee and talk.","I attract people who aren't warm and loving because I am warm. I have trouble discerning the bad guys, and when I do notice a red flag, I used to smother the feeling, like when I was growing up with my mother and father. I guess I thought that that was life. I am not romantically involved with anyone.","YouTube news shows and some other channels about politics and wildlife.. No Instagram, no TikTok, no Twitter, no Facebook. Too many hours of Time Management Games. I briefly dated a psychiatrist in the early 2000's, and he said I should be working at the Rand institute, not working as an admin asst.",No.,,"BA Psychology.

occupational or relational impairment","I have never been able to stick with school or work for very long without giving up, and it doesn't bother me even when I throw away great opportunities. I don't have drive/care to get myself out of the pattern, because I know it will likely happen again, I've been able to stay with a job for up to 2 years when I had a lot of drive and motivation, but was constantly detrimentally late. I have an obscure sleep pattern where I stay up all night, I've spent years trying to recalibrate but I always give in and end up staying up. I've gone days without sleep to attempt to correct this. every so often I have spurts of motivation where I make a thorough plans get absurd amounts of things done and within days complete drop it. But recently these spurts have been much less prevalent","I was kicked out of public school in 8th grade after having lifelong behavioral issues as far back as kindergarten, nearing the end leading up to I was suspended many times. throughout this time there was constant meetings and almost ""battle"" between the district and my parents. My issues were never violent or problematic issues with other kids it was always just goofing off or distracting the class maybe talking back to the teachers. I was almost always failing. Following this I was put into I believe 4 behavioral high schools before dropping out and getting my Hiset/GED online. during that time I would go weeks/ months without going to school and when I did I was completely un-present. The only other thing I can consider is I had a 5 year long relationship with my girlfriend throughout this time period, in which ended harshly with me being cheated on whilst she was in college. that was about 2 years ago, but I was extremely co-dependent and invested in that relationship so that has definitely effected my mental health.","I spend most of my waking hours in bed, only really leaving my room for food or to be with my friends. I used to have extreme paranoia in my teenage years which would effect my daily life severely I felt like a lot of my peers in my hometown did not like me, which was partially true and things did happen to cause concern. In this time I was extremely hyper vigilant, but over the course of the last 3 years I have entirely outgrown that and am now the opposite I'm very social don't feel paranoid at all and spend time around my local peers. I still do have areas to grow in that aspect, I get very uncomfortable and shy/awkward around extended family, and on occasion I will randomly become closed of and shy around people I know which is apparent it seems very out of character for me to them.","I've had several MRI's for multiple knee injuries. Never for head trauma.","Picky eater","As stated previously I have severe trouble sleeping and no sleep schedule. I will sleep at drastically different hours regularly. when I am tired I have no trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. I also over sleep severely commonly 15- even 20 hours at a time, even when previously sleeping over 8 hours not staying up over 16 hours. I require some form of light and a fan or air conditioner, and I usually fall asleep watching something on my phone.","I've tried therapy a few times throughout my life but I end up not showing up. I was attempting to use Adderall through a psychiatrist which did help but I never used it consistently and didn't like the side effects.","I am not currently seeing any psychological doctors/ most recently I was seeing a Psychiatrist over the phone briefly just regarding different ADHD medications. Her name is Tanya Gershman. I wound up skipping the appointments and being dropped. Before that I was seeing a different psychiatrist Heather Slack whom I was with for years just checking up every few months over the phone for different anxiety medications. When I was in elementary school I consistently saw a therapist Charles Pollard.","I took lexapro for a few months I believe before I took 40mg Prozac for 3-5 years I'm uncertain , I felt like I had over come my symptoms for taking that so I stopped. I then briefly took Wellbutrin for a week or so after that and stopped. I believe I stopped in 2022. I then tried different ADHD meds including Vyvanse 30mg, and adderall 10 mg. both of those do help but I don't combat the symptoms properly so I didn't have the best experience. (sleeping before, eating before/during, staying hydrated)","I do not think so. Potentially grandiosity/mania but I personally attribute those to ADHD symptoms.","Never self harm and rarely suicidal only in drastic situations which passed or if I've felt at a very low point","I've been using electronic cigarettes (vaping) consistently since probably 13. around ages 14-17 I smoked marijuana on and off and ending abruptly after getting to a point of daily use and having severe anxiety and ""high"" thoughts while sober which I did not like. I feel like I was still feeling negative side effects up to a year after stopping, it deeply abrupted my way of thinking and self image and esteem. After this I was very against the idea of any substance until I turned 21 and I slowly eased into drinking in which I have since picked up as a regular thing in my life. There was a point from late 21-recently I was drinking everyday and always wanting to drink socially. I did lead into drinking alone for a few months nightly in which I recognized as a problem and have since slowed down drastically currently. I use drinking to feel more social and less anxious when out. I partially attribute this to learning how to be more social and friendly and outgoing in general whilst sober.","psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis. I currently take Taltz injections monthly","Yes maternal ADHD and anxiety I am uncertain of others, and paternal anxiety",No,"Yes if not early","for hobbies Mechanics, hands on work in general, organization, history, video games, all outdoor activities, music. sports id say dirtbikes but not in an organization just with friends","physical therapist for multiple knee surgery rehab","I live at home with just my mother we have a good relationship I have an optimal living situation large house my own garage area pool woods/trails, I have 2 older brothers and older sisters who have since moved out and my father lives in California","I've never moved I've lived at my house my whole life my siblings moved out for college my oldest brother is married etc. My father got a great job opportunity in California and has since slowly moved there full time over the years at first he was visiting and then less and less, it just worked that way because my parents don't get along but its always been a very civil thing, they are still finically involved and talk daily and have a relationship and has never really been a hardship for me.","over the past few years my house has become very quiet and lonely as it used to be consistently busy and I was much more involved with my siblings lives and father as now I am naturally not, but this does not particularly bother me. all of my childhood my parents and siblings were very involved and has since faded into adulthood. Both my parents seemed to have their mental struggles but nothing significant. My mother was always quick to yell I attribute that to more of an anxiety thing, which has since passed as I grew up. when I was very young into early teenage years I was always in trouble or sent to my room or throwing fits. My dad was always an authority figure but was always relatively distant with me and my siblings. On my fathers side all of my aunts and uncles have history of mental health issues and drug abuse.","Emotional maturity socially, social awareness, knowledge on topics of interest, advice, problem solving with physical things, music","I've had the same group of friends since childhood and have picked up new long term friends within recent years, little to no drama ever but I do get frustrated with friends when they make repetitive mistakes in their personal lives, and I have an almost total lack of desire to initiate relationships romantically and intimatety","I've been in 2 relationships in my life both long term after my last 5 year relationship ended poorly 2 years ago I've had little to no desire to pursue anyone and times I've tried I've backed out and ended very quickly","tiktok I will mindlessly scroll for hours and YouTube occasionally my current daily average is 9 hours","I've had psych testing in childhood 1-2 times but haven't in 10ish years",n/a,"I dropped out in the middle of 10th grade and got my ged in 2020, I had an IEP throughout most of my school years, I touched on most of this previously",,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026712971019990522/6026712971019990522_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026712971019990522/6026712971019990522_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026712971019990522/6026712971019990522_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026712971019990522/6026712971019990522_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026712971019990522/6026712971019990522_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026712971019990522/6026712971019990522_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026712971019990522/6026712971019990522_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026712971019990522/6026712971019990522_base64_75_1726862098.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026712971019990522/6026712971019990522_base64_76_1726862098.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

This then kickstarts yet another period of lack of motivation and productivity, and I often fear I'll never let go of this pattern.","I was physically and emotionally abused as a child. I've noticed myself flinching at friends' sudden movements and my heart rate increases whenever there is perceived conflict or confrontation. Every time, I can almost directly link a situational stressor to a past traumatic event. I get most of my flashbacks when sleep-deprived. I also fail to set boundaries out of fear of rejection, invalidation and confrontation.","I was often described as ""sensitive"" as a kid. I've always had a reactive and volatile mood but I've become concerningly good at hiding it instead of projecting it. I often feel lost or ostracized in social situations.",No.,,"My sleep has become significantly better once I started 10mg of hydroxyzine before going to bed, have my room as cold as it can get, have proper ventilation aimed directly at me, and have multiple layers of blankets. I tend to put my AC unit in when the temperature hits anywhere around 50 degrees Farenheit, and tend to leave my window cracked through some of winter. I never turn my heater on through the night.","I'm currently taking zoloft, hydroxyzine and focalin on a daily basis, I've gone on runs, I've been in therapy multiple times, and read self help books and articles occasionally. Most of these are only effective for a few months and then progress plateaus.","I've been in therapy three separate times in the past. When I was 10, I saw a psychologist because I was displaying signs of depression, anxiety, and overall emotional instability. From ages 16 to 19, I was going to student therapist program, where I had two different therapists. I started going to a therapist last year, but determined we weren't a good fit, and didn't proceed to find a replacement. I have a psychiatric nurse practitioner (Katrina Sivo-Souza) managing my medication, and will begin sessions with a new therapist on 9/24 with Sophia Sgarlat.","I'm currently taking zoloft 75mg, hydroxyzine 10mg, and dexmethylphenidate (focalin) 10mg daily. I've tried wellbutrin, abilify, and ritalin in the past. Wellbutrin caused dissociation. Abilify caused immediate severe adverse reactions. Ritalin has caused anxiety (and so has focalin, which will be discussed with my medication manager).","I do have a history of paranoia.","I went through intermittent suicidal ideation for most of my teens (14-17), and had an intense suicidal episode early last year. I have a history of harmful self-regulating behaviors, such as skin picking, scratching, hitting, biting, touching hot surfaces, and running my hands under really hot water.","No. My parents were alcoholics when I was a child, and the idea of being under the influence makes me anxious.",No.,"All of my nuclear family has been diagnosed with ADHD, and most have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, OCD, and C-PTSD. Both of my parents have siblings with ADHD and OCD, and I have 2 autistic cousins on my mom's side, out of 4.","I was born 11 days overdue. My mother was in induced labor for over 12 hrs before doctors decided to deliver me via c-section. I was born with high bilirubin levels and was thoroughly tested for natal diabetes because of my weight.","My parents recount me being hyper-verbal at a young age. My first words were phrases instead of the usual ""mama"" or ""dada,"" and could speak full and complex sentences by the time I was 2.","I've always been musically inclined, but everything I know has been self-taught. I taught myself English  (my first language is Spanish) and have always had a strong affinity for language acquisition, and I'm picking up Portuguese and Italian. Vintage decore thrifting and collecting has become one of my favorite hobbies over the last couple of years. I also picked up fiber arts (knitting, crocheting, cross stitching, and sewing) last year, and I now do it during my off time most days of the week.","I had a speech impediment as a kid (didn't know how to pronounce 's' sounds), and was taken to a speech specialist when I was 8. The doctor determined my impediment was not anatomical, and my parents did not proceed with taking me to therapy. I wasn't able to train myself out of it until months of self-training.","I live in a 4 bedroom home with 3 roommates, all of which I'm pretty close friends with.","I moved from Puerto Rico to Boston in 2022, and that was a shocking change in my daily routine and living situation. My parents are still married, but they fought a lot when I was younger. My mom (who made about half of our home income) lost her job in the 2008 recession, and coming home to our power being shut off was a common experience. In 2017, we lost everything in our home in a greywater flood during Hurricane María, and that was a traumatic experience in it of itself.","My parents had me at an age where they were not planning on having children. They had just met, and those were the cards that they were dealt with, and they just did what they could with what they had. I grew up in an extremely volatile household, and I often dreaded going back home after school or family sleepovers. I hated weekends because I knew I'd be most subject to my dad's behavior under the influence (ie abuse, drunk driving, etc.) I felt very lonely during the summer, because my parents refused to take me to friends' houses during summer and winter breaks. My parents would also miss out on school events that were of importance to me.

Regarding extended family mental health, my grandma on my dad's side of the family died from an overdose before I was born, and it is unclear whether it was intentional.","I've learned to be patient and considerate, and I tend to prioritize other people's comfort and convenience, though sometimes to a fault.","I have few, but very close friendships. I prefer to spend time with people whom I feel like their presence recharges my social battery instead of draining it. I struggle to make plans with friends that don't fit that category.","I've always craved relationship and intimacy, but I didn't go on my first date until I was 22. I feel romantically and intimately stunted, and I feel like I'm contantly trying to keep up with dating and hookup culture. I've never had a commited, monogamous, relationship. If anything, this has led to non-commited relationships where I put the other person's wants over my needs. I often leave relationships and even hookups feeling used and coerced.","I would say I'm on social media an average of 4 hours a day, including the time I have youtube on as background noise.","I was tested for autism at the age of 5 per my school staff's recommendation. I was instead diagnosed as a ""gifted child,"" and the recommended ""treatment"" was jumping me up a grade. My parents decided to move me schools instead. I was also subjected to psychometric testing at 12, but I'm unaware of the reasoning.","Emerson College, currently on my second year off, but I'll be a second semester junior when I come back.","I always felt like I was ahead of my classmates without putting much effort into my academics, but that all came to a halt when I reached high school and academic demands exceeded my nonadaptive academic capability. I struggled to keep up with my classmates and went from academic excellence to an average GPA lower than 3.5, which made me disappointed and my parents enraged. Up until my last year in school, after transferring to Emerson, I failed to allot an appropriate amount of time to my studies and extracurriculars.",,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026669260223947043/6026669260223947043_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026669260223947043/6026669260223947043_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026669260223947043/6026669260223947043_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026669260223947043/6026669260223947043_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026669260223947043/6026669260223947043_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026669260223947043/6026669260223947043_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026669260223947043/6026669260223947043_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026669260223947043/6026669260223947043_base64_75_1726857728.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026669260223947043/6026669260223947043_base64_76_1726857729.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026669260223947043/6026669260223947043_signature_55.png,,

forgetting multi step instructions","What I should be treated for with medication and what type of therapy would help or what to focus on in therapy.","Verbal abuse and sexual abuse","Intense mood swings, slight paranoia but I'm not really sure if you would call it that, irritability, worried.","One concussion in September 2018 which is when a lot of my symptoms worsened.","Over-compensatory exercise","White noise, complete darkness, and a fan. I sleep a lot and am always tired.","I have been in therapy and seen a PNP since 2018. I am now also seeing a dietitian. I exercise regularly and eat well. I am very good at practicing self care. I think I have found a good medication combination currently.","Yes I have seen about 5 therapists since 2018. The one I am seeing right now I have been with for two years. Her name is Kaitlyn Hall and she is at Castlebrook Counseling. I see her once a week I have seen three prescribers (I think they were all PNPs) since 2018. The one I am seeing right now I have been with for 3 years. Her name is Samantha Deglaoui and she is at Vendetti Wellness Group. I see her once a month or more as needed.","I have been on many many psychotropic medications. I will need to look through my files and find the list because it is extensive. I am currently on Wellbutrin (150mg), Sertraline (50mg), and Caplyta (42mg). I have been on Wellbutrin for 4 years, Sertraline for 6 months, and Caplyta for two months. I feel pretty stable currently on this combination. Which is the first time ever.","My PNP thinks I might experience tactile hallucinations sometimes.","Suicidal Ideation but no attempts. Self-harming (cutting) but not since 2021.","I used to take edibles because I thought they would help my anxiety. I took them about once a week for 6 months, but I ended up having a very bad reaction one time where I was hallucinating and twitching involuntarily and my mom had to call an ambulance, but they said I was fine and it would pass. I have not taken edibles since. That was in May 2022.","I have always struggled with my health and am always sick or tired and achy. My PCP thinks it could be autoimmune, so I am seeing a Rheumatologist next week. I have seen an Endocrinologist, Rheumatologist, a Lyme Disease specialist (I think he was a rheumatologist), and a Geneticist. The Geneticist I saw a little over a year ago and he diagnosed me with hEDS. He also recommended I get tested for POTs, but I have not. I am not on any medications for this.","Nothing that has been diagnosed.",No,"I started walking at 14 months which I guess was a little late but they attributed that to the fact that I could not see. I have very bad eye sight and have no depth perception.","I am in college currently, but I am on a medical leave this semester. I work at a skilled nursing facility, a gym, and I am a dog walker. I typically like to go to the gym or exercise outside, but I cannot right now because of how sick I am. I enjoy cooking, shopping, and hanging out with my friends whenever I have the opportunity.","I saw a physical therapist after my concussion for about a month. I saw a different physical therapist from January 2024-May 2024 for back pain because I have scoliosis and sciatic nerve pain.","I live at my mom and dad's house with my older sister.",No,"My dad is an alcoholic and while he has calmed down in the past couple years, he was very bad growing up and hit me a couple times, but mostly he was verbally abuse towards everyone in my family. He seems like he has a sort of depression and his anxiety comes out as anger. Same with my brother. I believe my dad also struggled with drug addiction before he met my mom, but they do not talk about it. My dad and mom had rough childhoods.","I think the biggest thing for me is that I care very deeply. I would do anything for my friends and family. I have very big reactions to things that may seem small, both good and bad. I am a really good student and a hard worker.","I have no problem initiating friendships, but I take things very personally so sometimes I end friendships for reasons that do not seem valid. I have strong personal standards and I also have strong standards for my friends and partner. I have experienced a lot of relationships with drama and things usually end badly. I also have always felt the need to be in a romantic relationship and feel lost when I am not in one.","I have a lot of trust issues even when there is not a reason. I do not have a strong sex drive and don't really enjoy sex. I have trouble regulating my emotions in general, but especially in relationships. I am very codependent even though I would like to not be. One of my ex boyfriends sexually assaulted me in my sleep. A different ex boyfriend would always ""persuade"" me into sex even if I said no.","My daily average from last week was 5 1/2 hours. I have been working with my therapist to try to limit my screen time, but being sick makes that difficult because all I want to do is lay in bed on my phone. I use tiktok and Instagram this most and sometimes snapchat. I do not like the way social media effects me.","I have a neuropsych eval in early 2021 for ADHD.","Framingham State University- Junior","My senior year of high school I missed 4 months of school because I was in a partial hospitalization program. The day I went back to school we got sent home early because of covid and never went back. I went to Endicott College for my first year. I had changed my major during the second semester, so then I decided to switch schools. I went to my first few days of orientation at Bentley University and moved out and decided to take a gap year for my mental health. The next summer I changed my major again and transferred to Framingham State and I have been there for two full years.","I am not sure if I missed the place to tell you this, but I did TMS treatments in December 2021 - Febuary 2022. I fund this very helpful for my depression for a while, but it seemed like my anxiety had gotten worse after.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026616985777765230/6026616985777765230_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026616985777765230/6026616985777765230_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026616985777765230/6026616985777765230_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026616985777765230/6026616985777765230_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026616985777765230/6026616985777765230_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026616985777765230/6026616985777765230_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026616985777765230/6026616985777765230_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026616985777765230/6026616985777765230_base64_75_1726852499.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6026616985777765230/6026616985777765230_base64_76_1726852499.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

difficulty completing tasks","About 4 years ago I went on medication primarily for depression and anxiety. I do believe it has helped with depression but I still feel rather anxious. At my last physical I mentioned wanting to be for ADHD as those are also symptoms of ADHD.  I do also struggle socially at times because of the anxiety and the fear of rejection so I tend to avoid initiating conversations and plans.","I don't know if it is technically categorized as trauma but my parents fought A LOT when I was a child and got separated and divorced when I was in high school.  I know that weighed on me a lot when I was younger and even now.  My mother was also diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis when I was in the 1st grade.  This added a lot of responsibility to me as a young child.","As stated above I can struggle socially.  I have a lot of friends that I've had since I was a kid but meeting new people and initiating conversations can be tough.  I fear rejection and would rather avoid putting myself in those situations and stick to the friends I know.  I can also be fairly irritable.  I work with kids and can find myself becoming frustrated easily at times.",No,"Emotional over eating","I usually smoke marijuana before bed to help me sleep but would like to get away from that.  I also need some sort of noise to fall asleep.  Typically I turn on a tv show I have seen many times so I can listen without watching.  When I do both of those things I can fall sleep pretty quickly.  However I do tend to wake up in the middle of the night.  Sometimes to use the bathroom sometimes I think it's because I'm afraid I'm going to oversleep, something I did a lot as a kid.","I went to therapy in college for a bit to deal with some family struggles and that helped me navigate that time in my life.  I tried again when I went on Prozac but I found it hard to connect with the therapist via tele-health so I stopped going. 

I enjoy exercising and try to get to the gym once a day to at least stretch and walk.  I read while on the treadmill and find that relaxing.  

I also like to craft.  I find it difficult to sit and watch tv without doing something else so I took up crocheting and really enjoy that.","I saw a therapist the summer of 2011 and then again in the fall of 2020 but don't remember their names.  The second time was only 2 or 3 appointments before I stopped.","I am on Prozac.  I recently bumped down from 30 mg to 20 mg as I believe the depressive feelings I was taking it for were becoming more manageable.","I can get paranoid sometimes in social settings that people are looking at me. 
I don't think its mania exactly but I do find there are times I have more energy than others and get a lot of things done, especially around the house.",No,"I do smoke most nights before bed as a way to wind down and go to sleep.  I know this probably isn't the best method though.","Only the prozac","My mother and brother were both diagnosed with ADHD as adults.",No,"Yes, I was walking relatively quickly, around 9 months I believe.","I coach freshmen volleyball in the fall and varsity lacrosse in the Spring.  I am also a class advisor at the school I work at.",No,"I currently live alone since October 2023.","I recently switched roles at school from a social studies teacher to an online learning teacher due to cut positions.  I went from living with one roommate to living in a new apartment alone. 

My parents separated my junior year of high school and were officially divorced my freshman year of college.","My parents fought incredibly frequently when I was a child, about as long as I could remember.  It did occasionally get violent (throwing things).  My brother and I didn't really talk about it.  My mother was diagnosed with MS when I was in the first grade and my dad worked out of town a lot which meant my brother and I had a lot of added responsibilities at a young age.  When my parents separated and my brother was in college I spent a lot of time alone while my mom was in and out of rehab (physical rehab not for substance abuse).  I feel like I cared primarily for myself during those years. 

My mothers grandfather struggled with alcoholism and was institutionalized most of his life. My father's two brothers struggle with alcoholism. 

I don't know if it is the MS or ADHD but in my opinion my mother exhibits signs of bipolar disorder.  She experiences very low lows and high highs (again just in my opinion).","I think I am a great friend, daughter and teacher.  I care a lot about other people and enjoy seeing my students/athletes succeed.  I also think I have a great sense of humor.","I have had the same group of friends for most of my life.  And I wouldn't say I lack the desire to initiate relationships but I fear rejection.  I often assume if people wanted to talk/hangout with me they would ask and if they aren't then they don't want to.","I haven't had a serious relationship since college.  I've gone on dates and seen people for short periods of time but no official relationships.  I don't ever approach people I may be interested in out in public, again with the mentality if they wanted to talk to me or were interested they would act first.","Now that school is back in session I use it much less. Maybe 2 hours a day? Weekends would be a bit more.  Mostly instagram and tik tok.",No,n/a,"I have a bachelors and Masters Degree in history and have continued taking classes to advance my salary","I can't think of anything at the moment!",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6025745552429135556/6025745552429135556_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6025745552429135556/6025745552429135556_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6025745552429135556/6025745552429135556_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6025745552429135556/6025745552429135556_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6025745552429135556/6025745552429135556_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6025745552429135556/6025745552429135556_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6025745552429135556/6025745552429135556_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6025745552429135556/6025745552429135556_base64_75_1726765357.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6025745552429135556/6025745552429135556_base64_76_1726765357.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

She was likely an alcoholic and had severe untreated mental illness. Killed herself last year after a few weeks of trying to get me to help her with the suicide. 

Dad was a bystander—failed to protect me—and very emotionally negligent. Still abandons me to this day. I was the scapegoat of my family. Mom also abused dad. A lot of domestic violence, extremely dysfunctional household. I try to avoid sleeping in my closet. I was bullied in elementary school and shunned by my peers for much of my life. No one helped me. Teachers punished and screamed at me, from the age of 4, or made me feel grossly incompetent, even in university. I’m not sure why I faced so much cruelty. Maybe I deserved it. 

At USC: I was raped in 2021 several times, as well as stalked. I haven’t really been able to talk about it with anyone. In one instance, I was taken advantage of sexually when facing a medical emergency.

I recently got my last case manager from treatment (in tx April-May 2024) fired for inappropriate, sexual, predatory behavior: exploiting my current vulnerable state of mind and violating professional and personal boundaries. Despite that, he’s been continuing to contact me and causing me distress. This incident is reminding me of the sexual trauma I experienced back in 2021. 

I’ve had many, many nightmares and flashbacks. I tend to feel emotionally numb and dissociated. A recent nightmare involves my case manager showing up outside my house unannounced, which he’s mentioned a few times. 

Even though I was in treatment for over a year, from late 2021 to the end of 2022, my trauma still haunts me… it’s really impacted my ability to function and live a normal life. I can’t feel any inkling of hope.","I’ve been isolating for the past couple of months even though I’m normally a very social person and love talking to people. I also haven’t been going to therapy or taking psych medication. I’ve lost interest in everything, and it’s very difficult to get myself to eat or shower or do anything. Inability to feel pleasure in any activity. Concentration is poor. 

I’ve felt at times that someone’s chasing me or out to get me. I’ve experienced psychosis in the past, as well as hallucinations. 

It doesn’t concern me—I find it vaguely interesting—but I lack remorse, guilt, empathy, compassion, and care for others. I don’t experience love, pity, benevolence, or the desire to be helpful to others. 

In the past, I’ve had quite a few mood swings. I think I’m generally emotionally unstable and volatile and erratic. No recent mania.","No. MRI scan was normal. Still, I wonder if there’s any structural differences in my brain.",,"I’ve experienced insomnia for much of my life, and I’ve taken sleep medication to help with that. Recently, my sleep’s been pretty terrible. It’s hard to stay asleep.","Extensive therapy, church, nootropics, yoga, journaling, spending time in nature, creating art, self/help books, talking to friends… 

Not sure if any of my therapists have truly been helpful.","After my mom killed herself, I started working with Meghan Shamburger. I worked with her for almost a year. Haven’t really seen her recently though. She’s a trauma therapist who’s familiar with working with patients with autism and DID. 

The last psychiatrist I worked with was Dr. Ngoy from Harbor UCLA. Stopped working with him quite a few months ago.","Not currently taking any medication. 
In the past:
-Prazosin: ineffective for nightmares 
-Lamictal and Abilify were helpful for quite a while. Then, they stopped working and I was placed on a 52:50 in April
-Zoloft 
-Latuda
-Wellbutrin: did nothing 
-Vyvanse: seemed to help with executive functioning 
-Topamax: really impaired cognitive functioning, including memory, and made me feel lethargic 
-olanzapine: experienced weight gain 
-Lithium: side effect: dry mouth 
-Lexapro: caused increased suicidality and a severe anxiety attack 
-Seroquel
-Remaron. I think for sleep?",Yes.,"Past self-harming behavior: predominantly cutting, but also head banging, scratching, punching… started self-harming at age 4. Self-harm increases with drug use. Often accompanied by dissociation. Some wounds were treated during one of my (many) hospitalizations with medical gauze and antibiotics. Feels like a compulsion. 

Suicidal ideation has been a constant for about 7 years now. I’ve attempted suicide in the past. I wasn’t in the best state of mind, very dissociated. It’s caused hospitalizations.","Alcohol and marijuana. Marijuana made my psychosis worse. Thought I was going to die, serious hallucinations. Regardless, I experienced an insatiable urge to use in the past. 

Recently, I’ve been going to bars by myself every night. I guess I don’t care about the damage it does to my body. I cope with painful feelings by drinking. I usually drink alone and prefer stronger alcohol. Stopping after a sip or two is almost impossible. Merely sipping in social situations is also painful.

I have a bottle of alcohol on my bedstand… just like my mom used to.","PCOS. Hypothyroidism. Not taking any medications currently.","Serious mental health issues on maternal side. Treatment resistant depression, hospitalizations, bipolar, likely ADHD, OCD, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder…

Mom and mom’s sister both committed suicide. Mom’s sister killed herself a few years ago. Jumped off 26th floor of apartment. Mom overdosed on sleeping pills.","I’ve never been pregnant.","Didn’t start talking until I was almost 4.","Not recently. I feel like a shell of my former self. In the past, I loved rock climbing, writing poetry, drawing, dancing, crocheting, making ceramics, and going to aerial silks classes. I also ran a lot.","Worked with a speech therapist when I was younger. Also had a physical therapist at one point.","Currently living at home with my dad. Twin brother is in the Bay Area.","Mom killed herself.","Mom had major mental health issues. Drank herself to sleep, raged at me when she couldn’t. Very violent. Parents pushed my brother and me to excel, completely neglecting our emotional needs. Brother wasn’t heavily abused like I was, has never acknowledged what I faced. Parents seemed to hate each other. There’s probably intergenerational trauma.","Persistence, creativity, resilience? I’m not sure.","I’ve had trouble maintaining long-term friendships or relationships my whole life. Relationships tend to be brief and intense.","Codependency, lack of boundaries","Not sure. I probably spend 1-2 hours a day on Reddit.","Yes, I was evaluated by you guys in January 2022.",N/A,"Failed all of my classes in elementary school, placed in remedial classes. Continued failing in middle school. No accommodations granted until college. 11th grade teacher in written report: “There’s definitely something wrong with her.” 12th grade teacher: “unusual interests for her age” 

Had to catch up on work and was constantly behind peers in elementary school. In high school: worked twice as hard as peers due to trouble with auditory processing. 

College: continued struggling with attention and focus.","Since doing the last assessment in 2022, I’ve been diagnosed with DID and ADHD. I have over 30 alters. 

I continue to have serious trouble with focus, concentration, starting and completing tasks, and educational/vocational goals. 

I view relationships as transactional and as a means to get what I want. People are disposable tools to me. I’m trying to figure out if I actually derive pleasure from hurting others physically/emotionally, or if I simply don’t care. Not sure. 

I have pretty poor impulse control and judgement. It’s hard for me to evaluate negative consequences to my behaviors and actions. I also experience chronic feelings of emptiness and boredom. It’s difficult for me to sense danger or threats; I tend to gravitate towards dangerous situations such as a series of electrical explosions. 

I mimic other people’s social behavior out of necessity. I don’t understand why people ask others if they’re okay. It’s also hard for me to relate to others on a deep level. I ask people about themselves if it somehow pertains to me or will benefit me, rather than genuine interest. 

I have trouble comprehending why stealing is morally wrong. I’ve stolen from other people and shoplifted in the past. I don’t feel that societal norms apply to me. I often have trouble following rules, instructions, or authority figures. I’ve been this way my whole life. I don’t believe I mentioned this during the last evaluation. 

My mom put me on a diet when I was 6, not letting me eat bread or rice. I probably have some body image issues and feel guilty/ashamed sometimes when I eat.

They went on for years, i also began being terrified i may be allergic to everything and that my throat would close up. I didn't want to try new things, wear nail polish, and eventually that led to being afraid of everything and only allowing myself to eat certain comfort foods or I would have an major anxiety attack.

forgetting multi step instructions","It is hard for me to focus on any task at hand, no matter what it is. 

My anxiety is debilitating to my life at this point. I have a very hard time doing any tasks in front of people in certain settings, even if I am familiar with the person and task. I will make mistakes I usually wouldn't make if I am alone bc of the anxiety. I doubt myself constantly and my anxiety stops me from making good decisions for myself. Day to day tasks are getting difficult. 

I am a blusher, which has caused social anxiety to arise in me. My neck, face and chest get red and blotchy and flushed when I am excited or anxious. No hives, just intense redness..so I always am in fear it will happen and people will notice and call me out for it. 

My mood swings are bad. I have not been able to manage them and it has caused difficulty in my life. I live with a severe overwhelming sense of hopelessness, and my lows can get very low. I stay in bed, I do not exercise, I don't shower, I dont eat or I overeat, I in no way shape or form take care of myself. My highs feel great, and I forget about all of the bad. I set all of these crazy expectations on myself and think I can keep it going...until the bad comes back. Then I feel like a loser for not doing what I said I would and I just feel more horrible.","oh, sweet Jesus yes. My mother did a NUMBER on me. Neglect, body shaming, food shaming. She ended up passing away in 2020 and was on hospice...and it got really difficult to see and be around but I was there a lot with her in the end. I have nightmares and flashbacks about that a lot. I guess I didn't realize in the moment how traumatizing it was, because I was just focused on being there for her. But now the thought stops me in my tracks. 

She was 80 pounds, barely any hair, couldn't walk anymore, was bedridden...it was so awful.","A lot of what is in those quotations I have trouble with. I feel an intense overwhelming sense of hopelessness, so getting out of bed is really hard for me. I usually don't until 1-2pm which no one knows. I'm really ashamed of it. My boyfriend leaves for work around 6am so he never knows, and I lie about what my days consist of usually. 

My mood swings are really tough. The lows are low and scary and the highs are great and make me feel like the bad isn't so bad. I let myself forget about it all, which is nice but also not real life or a good way to cope. I am extremely irritable, and I don't like it about myself. My emotions are all over the place and a bit of a trainwreck. it just depends on the day. no real rhyme or reason to it. I definitely notice i am more depressed about a week or so before my period too.",nope,"Binge eating
Emotional over eating","Sleep could definitely improve. I have a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep. I have tried melatonin sprays before but I never let myself use it too much. I dont want to depend on it. 

I like to listen to thunderstorm sounds on spotify or ""zen"" sounding music sometimes at night.","Therapy was always helpful to me. I always feel better after exercise and/or yoga I just can't get myself to always do that when I'm in a low point. I have tried meditating but I can't shut my brain off for that so it's been useless.","Yes! I only saw a psychiatrist after i admitted myself to the hosptial. I did intense therapy classes virtually (bc of covid)  5 days a week, 5 hours a day. The psychiatrist helped me start my new medications and checked in with me on those. 

in 2017 I started seeing a therapist, TIa LeBlanc at Inspire Health Alliance but she ended up getting a new job in 2019 and she referred me to her co-worker Amanda (can't remember last name) who I saw until 2021 when she got a new job herself. 

I took a break from therapy after that and recently I saw Emily Finch at Northeast Health Services but after a few months I realized she wasn't a great match for me so I ended our time together.","If Lexapro or hydroxyzine count then yes! but i no longer take them. Both definitely helped with my depression and anxiety. Along with me making positive choices such as exercise, walking and eating healthier food.","Nothing other than mania. However, I am not educated enough on it to actually confirm it is mania. My good mood swings are really wonderful and I forget all of the bad feelings, but they're fleeting. So i'm not sure if it actually is mania!","No severe symptoms at all. I do have thoughts of SI, but no plans to act on them. I just let the thoughts come and go but they don't affect my life.","Definitely no issues with abusing substances to self-medicate. I have been doing cocaine for a few years, socially. I feel no physical dependance or addiction to it.","I think just depression and anxiety but I can't remember the formal diagnosis. I was prescribed the generic version of lexapro and hydroxyzine as needed after I admitted myself to the hospital but after a year/year and a half there was a hiccup in my insurance and I had to quit cold turkey and I just never went back on them. 

I dont remember the MG of lexapro but I do know I increased once or twice throughout my time taking it.

ORiginally I was prescribed 50mg of hydroxyzine but it was WAY too intense so I went to 10mg.","paternal = bi-polar

maternal= suicide

maternal and paternal = depression, anxiety, addiction and ADHD","no children/no deliveries","I have no idea honestly.",nope,"Just a good old fashioned therapist. Is that an occupational therapist? I have no idea lol.","I live with my boyfriend of 4 years! 

Our landlord is upstairs (2 family) who is also my cousin, and we're very close. Him and his family + my boyfriend get along great.","I'm not sure how recent you're looking for but I lost my full time job of 4.5 years last June and it was really difficult on me. 

My boyfriend and I just moved in together for the first time in our new apt this July - which has been really fun so far.","I was 8 when my dad died so after that is all I can really remember with just my mom and my brother and me. She was really sick, but at the same time abusing the drugs she was prescribed. We lost the house and bounced from place to place. So, I moved a lot and never had stability until about 15-16. 

There are struggles on both sides of my family. Addiction, depression, anxiety on both. Bi-polar on my mom's side. ADHD on both.","I am a great friend and partner. I am really there for the people I love. I'm funny and can always make people laugh even if they're going through a hard time.","Not really. I have my core group of people and were solid. I've always just found if Im nice to new people it's easy to be friendly on both ends.","I have gravitated towards men that needed to be taken care of, I was the alpha. And i was pouring from an empty cup so they took a toll on me. I seek validation from men and it means WAY too much from me. That is really the only validation I hold to be important. 

I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years and he is wonderful, but I have a hard time accepting the good. Im always anxious waiting for another shoe to drop. I make up cheating and lying scenarios in my head almost daily. It's not fun.","I am on instagram and tik-tok. Definitely way too much, it's gross. I am also on linkedin but I have only ever used that for job searches and things like that.","nope! nothing like this","nope, graduated a while ago.","I graduated college with a bachelors degree in communications with a public relations minor in 2018. School was difficult for me. Focusing and retaining information was hard. My grades were never impressive, but I passed! nope","I have no clue what is wrong with me and my brain, but I would not fill out this form and wast anyone time if I didn't think something was. It took me years to admit something actually was. I am someone that loves control and I have always thought that I can overcome anything on my own. 

I am in a bad way, and I have been for a while. And I feel in my heart and soul that this is something I can not control, so here I am. The good news is though, that I want help and I don't want to feel this way anymore. I am willing to do the work, just need some guidance.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6018274500324359360/6018274500324359360_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6018274500324359360/6018274500324359360_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6018274500324359360/6018274500324359360_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6018274500324359360/6018274500324359360_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6018274500324359360/6018274500324359360_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6018274500324359360/6018274500324359360_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6018274500324359360/6018274500324359360_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6018274500324359360/6018274500324359360_base64_75_1726018251.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6018274500324359360/6018274500324359360_base64_76_1726018252.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

difficulty completing tasks
forgetting multi step instructions","I would like to think of myself as a highly motivated indivudual but I sway off track pretty often. I have difficulty completing one of the 10 tasks I start at once, get sidetracked, and then feel defeated when I’ve seemingly made no progress but have lost the day. I often go through waves of feeling motivated followed by defeat/inadequacy. I’ve always thought this was something I just had to work out but I’m looking for some help.","I have a history of emotional trauma with my parents. I’m 31 now and I’ve regularly seen a therapist throughout my adult life. I get stuck on certain trains of thought/have a difficult time setting boundaries because I’m fearful I’ll upset someone.","I tend to isolate when I’m in a low place.","No head injuries.","Binge eating
Purging
Over-compensatory exercise
Emotional over eating","My sleep is good for the most part, when I’m in a low period I have difficulty falling asleep but it’s only by a few hours here and there.","Self help books, exercise, I regularly practice yoga, love my peloton and walking my dog. When I’m able to stick to a regular exercise routine I feel good but if I miss a day or feel that I’ve eaten something bad or too much I get off track mentally and physically. I beat myself up for not being perfect.","I am currently seeing a therapist and she’s great! I’ve seen a psychiatrist in the past (Lauren Collier, Plymouth Beth Isreal) and I really enjoyed her but I was diagnosed at the time with depression.","I’ve tried Wellbutrin, Zoloft, and Celexa. I’m not really interested in going back on one but I’m open to talk about it.","No issues with psychosis.",No.,"No issues with recreational drug use. I use to smoke weed but I started a business last year and found that it didn’t my productivity/motivation so I stopped. I very rarely drink, once every few months if that.",No.,"ADHD on my paternal side.","Never been pregnant.","Yes I haven’t been informed otherwise.","I practice yoga at my favorite studio in Centerville (more in the off season to avoid Cape traffic), I love hikes/walks with my dog and boyfriend, I go to the gym regularly.",No.,"I live with my boyfriend with our dog and cat.","I got divorced last year, it was amicable and we filed uncontested. We still have a line of communication and have each happily moved on.","Very volatile upbringing. I’m the oldest of 4, divorces on both sides multiple times. Never any accountability taken from either parent. I felt alone a lot and did not feel supported or loved unconditionally. Neither parent was diagnosed with anything (Dad ADHD but he didn’t want to take anything that would stifle his creativity) but I think my Mom was depressed. No suicide on either side.","I am kind and creative. I’m a good listener and enjoy adventures with my friends. Going on hikes/ exploring towns and coffee shops. I love animals and my dog is my world. I am a great cook and enjoy learning about health and nutrition. I’m a hard worker and I’m strong, I have a small gardening business based on the Cape. I’m open and willing to learn and grow, even and especially when it’s hard.","When I’m isolating I have a hard time wanting to get out there but I have a really good group of girls that I spend time with regularly. I’d love to try new things but finding the time and energy outside of what I’m already doing has been difficult.","I have trust issues, believing that I can be loved and cared for long term. I’ve struggled with feeling like I’m not good enough and too much. I’m in a very healthy loving and balanced relationship now with an incredibly emotionally intelligent man. I struggle with codependency and not basing my world around him, but when I feel that happening we are able to talk about it. I have trouble regulating my emotions, not feeling like I’m being swallowed whole by the world is hard sometimes but eventually I’m able to come out of it.","~1-2 hours depending on if I’m creating posts for Instagram for my business.",No.,"Quincy College","I have my high school diploma, I went to school for a year right out of high school and it wasn’t for me. I’ve worked sat restaurants and gardened until two years ago when I went out on my own gardening. I find it incredibly challenging but everyone around me says I’m talented and should keep going. But I’m not sure, I feel very overwhelmed or I feel like I’m not busy enough and then subsequently bad about it/like I’m not doing something right. I’m going back to school this Fall to get an associates degree and study accounting and math to help with my business or give me an opportunity to branch out and try a new job. I have a hard time focusing in class without thinking of other things but I do that while I do everything. Cleaning, working, working out. I’m thinking of 100 things at once/all the time.","Thank you for the opportunity, overall I’m incredibly fortunate to be living this life. I am looking for insight on my restlessness in my career, my disorganization followed by manic reorganization/projects cycle, regularity in my friendships and relationships, and lack of focus. I know I’m capable of more I just feel stuck.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6014555343816381795/6014555343816381795_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6014555343816381795/6014555343816381795_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6014555343816381795/6014555343816381795_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6014555343816381795/6014555343816381795_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6014555343816381795/6014555343816381795_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6014555343816381795/6014555343816381795_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6014555343816381795/6014555343816381795_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6014555343816381795/6014555343816381795_base64_75_1725646357.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/6014555343816381795/6014555343816381795_base64_76_1725646357.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

occupational or relational impairment","Types and focuses on therapy, occupational impairments beyond current physical impairments already experiencing; RA is currently somewhat-moderately controlled. Since Covid I just can't hold up the facades I had. I can't chameleon like I used to and have had regression on various skills to varying degrees as well. Part of this is from current therapy and acknowledging the massive burnout I had been bearing for a very long time in addition to other mental issues and physical ones I carry. I hope you know what to pick through with this explanation and throughout the following answers.","I think the correct term is CPTSD; I have experienced the following: Very Early Childhood trauma within familial environment that is barely remembered involving highly probable molestation, some neglect. Childhood continued with social issues within schooling environment, bullying from 4th grade to the end of high school, during which it was extreme dehumanization between 6th - 8th. Suffered physical, social, emotional abuse and manipulation from peers - not enough for hospital visits, but only just. During high school some manipulation and emotional abuse continued, and I was molested during class and outside of class by a classmate (""friend""). I have a lot of avoidances, I learned how to chameleon as best I could from watching other students since most bullying had died down and I can remain an outlier. Bringing this all up is still very painful and I do get physical responses thinking about it all.","How is poor social skills related to mood? Yes, but how? Isolating habits are a concern. Making friendship bonds? Anxiety in general I am not sure if I do have enough mood swings to have a solid concern on them but enough that a little look about that wouldn't hurt. I have difficulty using the right words for emotions.","I think I have had one or two concussions in my lifetime, teen into adulthood. Never brought to a hospital. I also have had two disturbing incidents of loss of consciousness. First one, late night witching hour drive home from work. I was driving but I was unconscious. My body was following the road, I assume from muscle memory, however regained consciousness as I was running a stop sign no accidents except embarrassment stopping into a bush and causing concern to a passerby. Second incident travelling off Cape to a friend, driving. Entered rotary to head towards Wareham, brief loss - found myself still properly at speed limit but having missed the turn off and already rounding again. I had to pull over safely for my own piece of mind. No car issues or blaring horns from other people.","Picky eater
Emotional over eating","It works in cycles. There is a pattern that while isn't consistent, and punctual like a clock but there is some disturbances. I do not take sleeping medications. It starts off with hard to go to sleep, then sometimes its hard to stay asleep. I used to over sleep as a way of isolation and getting away from being overwhelmed. I would hide away and sleep on a blanket on the floor when I was a child during the day.","I will never go back to a church. I hate exercise. Self help books are an okay read, they mean well. I am not flexible to perform yoga. Occasionally do meditation. It works sometimes, very inconsistent, additionally may do more harm than good.  I had some therapy as an early adult, stopped and then restarted, and still taking therapy. I have a psychologist as well for medications and these last bits are working in progress.","As above yes. I forget the first woman's name it was extremely brief - 4ish sessions at most for maybe less than half a year. Currently seeing Melissa Menangas as my therapist for 2-3 years (I have difficulty remembering time-frames), but I am seeking a therapist that has more knowledge with Autism at some point depending on how things go. My psychiatrist is Gloria Barnett-Duncan. I have started with her recently, within the year-ish. Both are from Northeast Behavioral.","I currently take: 3 tablets Escitalopram 5mg daily, 2 tablets Lamotrigine 25mg daily. I tend to be minorly tired after taking these just enough to notice it. I have been recently prescribed 1 capsule Hydroxyzine Pam 25mg 3 times daily - I have been too high in anxiety to take it after I had said I didn't want medication changes. I was bait and switched by my psychiatrist. Previous medication that caused side effects Setraline HCL in 25mg 1 tablet, once daily at first and then adjusted later to 50mg tablets take 1.5 tablets once daily. Both times suicidal intrusive thoughts became apparent when taking medication not long after and worsened at higher dosage.","No. I have sensory sensitivities though. I can hear electricity a bit TVs are terrible if they're old It was worse with the old tube TVs, Fluorescent lighting. The patterns of hums and thrums from other devices occasionally.","From previous medication side effects, I also had thought of it during the onset of my RA when I was physically at my lowest and in 8th grade I did cut myself to see if I could slit my wrists and found that I was too much of a coward to do it. I did not like the pain.","No issues: I do not have a medical card however I treat marijuana as an as needed medication. I will micro dose with carefully selected strains that are available, designed to help treat spikes of anxiety, depression, lack of energy via a vape cartridge, or a ""DaVinci"" device which bakes a specific measurement of product rather than burns for less carcinogens as that is easiest to control and can choose said strain for those reasons. Worst side effects I've gotten are becoming sleepy, dry mouth, or munchies which does help with minor appetite issues. No psychosis, paranoia or other side effects.","Rheumatoid Arthritis - not completely controlled or in remission, currently taking Rinvoq 15mg 1 tablet daily, Folic Acid 1mg tablet daily. Diabetes Type 2, unmonitored (I have a SEVERE fear of needles.) - taking Glipizide 5mg 1 tablet once daily with Januvia 100mg 1 tablet once daily.","Father's side, mother had severe symptoms of paranoia in old age. I believe my father's brothers may have health issues however I do not know what they are or if they are undiagnosed. There is once incident on mother's side of a great-(great?)-grandparent having schizophrenia. Although that could have been the one that ""had a head injury and started talking to ghosts"".","I was termed as a double breach baby at delivery. Which means not only was I turned around, but I was folded, literately trying to go ass first out of the birth canal. I was successfully turned around. Additionally I was a late baby, and hadn't been ready at original timing for delivery. I suspect on potential substance exposure in utero, though not directly through mum but in environmental second-second hand.","""I was a gifted child. I was a good child. Reading and talking early. There was nothing wrong with me."" However no one looked into my toe-walking closely. I ""grew out of it"".","During school I had few, piano from 4-19, although lessons I say had stopped around 14 by that time my teacher had become more of a colleague as we moved well beyond learning to play, and theory, to crafting and composing. I went to Cape Cod Tech and learned a trade - Graphic Arts, it was the first time I at least had somewhat fit in with my weirdness and had been complimented on it. I played Dungeons and Dragons from 15+ I still do occasionally it's a lot harder now. Video games otherwise had been a saving grace, the rise of MMORPGs and anonymity of the internet helped to reduce anxieties of face to face communication and remove other people's biases. This is where I grew the most socially. Currently still play different games. I had, and have gotten into streaming, as a socio-creative outlet.","I was a LMT myself, so technically I have worked with other therapists. However if you are referring to working with such therapists for working on specific injuries or aspects and issues personally, then no. Nothing more than I would get a discounted massage once a month from a fellow coworker that we were entitled to while working at the business I was formerly employed at.","Current situation: At childhood home, living in a studio apartment at basement level, habitation with significant other. Living maternal grandmother and owner of the house above at main floor, and mum, on top floor apartment. I have a sibling, born female at birth as I am recently moved out two months ago. I have already been married and divorced once, the kids that I do have currently are furry four legged, we have two corgi boys. I have had other fur-kids in the past as well.","Parents separated 7-8 years ago. It was very emotionally charged and damaging. Despite the age it is a sticking point.","Our family is rather broken. We are not very close to my father's two brothers. Fights. They were heavily into drugs early adulthood. One of them incarcerated once or twice. A cousin also incarcerated with drug issues for a small time but has managed to get beyond that. Court dates and a nasty rumor of pedophilia with one of my uncles. I'm sure my father has a lot of issues, from anger to narcissism to being an alcoholic, and his brothers that were never addressed and much generational trauma that has been passed down. I would even suspect there is Autism. Maternal grandmother is no saint but, not as outwardly volatile, subtler, manipulative.","I bend over backwards until I break. I am extremely loyal I have kindness and a strong sense of correcting injustices. I will help out to the detriment of myself.

And I say relationships, we are not talking about friends. Friends is a loose term that is expected to be said of people when referring to them after you have maintained an indeterminate timeframe of an unknown number of interactions per individual. That being said. If I have CHOSEN you. You are no longer 'friend' you are somewhere akin to family until such time that I may invariably be betrayed in some form or fashion.","I have had one boyfriend whom I married at 21. He was abusive after the fact and half a year in he filed for divorce. Found out in the middle of the divorce he had cheated on me and was having a baby with his mistress. However blamed me squarely for a lack of intimacy and sex as well as financial support. I think you may start to link up a pattern of reinforced issues of social, trust, intimacy and support that I have lacked pretty much all of my life. I don't even trust my own libido, and often don't feel safe with sex. The classmate in high school nearly raped me, however it was interrupted. The memory is fuzzy but I think it was his mother coming home drunk and unknowingly interrupted, I was able to call home and get away. I kept quiet, it was a learned behavior.","Doom scrolling is a phrase of the century. Tik tok is a visual stim for me. Youtube, or more commonly I watch streamers on Twitch.

I understand that you do NOT administer ADOS-2. I do not know if it is a specific requirement for SSDI or needed to be part of my case. Regardless of that information or not, I hope that this testing will help me better help me find the tools I need. I have taken evaluations from Embrace Autism which have indications in that direction, in my research of trying to achieve understanding, the why's that plague me, however I did not save those results. If that is something you would strongly recommend as a professional in the field I would also greatly appreciate the help in seeking a lead out as well although the prospect and mere thought of getting this additional test is mentally exhausting as I've already struggled to get so far as to here. Getting I guess, you would say a regular? Neuropsychological evaluation. By the way your website doesn't allow me to upload a photo of my insurance cards. It would not detect my webcam.

More often lately, this leads to a mental breakdown as the pressure becomes unbearable.",No,"- very inconsistent sleep schedule / insomnia
- very irritable with minor mistakes
- paranoia of being betrayed / abandoned
- isolating from friends / loved ones
- very avoidant of working (procrastination), tension and anxiety accumulates as deadline approaches and often leads to break down",None,,"Very inconsistent and difficult. Often stay up well past midnight (often around 3 am or later) and very rarely will get up from bed before noon unless 'forced' to via classes / meetings. Will often fall back asleep and wake later in the afternoon.

Falling asleep is very difficult, almost always takes around an hour to fall asleep, and getting up usually takes around the same amount of time.

Background noise / ASMR is often used as a sleeping aid.","Light exercise, shift in eating habits. Self-help videos sometimes used.","Two times:

First therapist I cannot recall, was back in Texas at around 2017 and was very short-lived.

Second therapist was with Gena Loubeau via ""Through the Forest Counseling"" at around April 2022, weekly meetings that spanned at least a month.","Escitalopram in 2017, used for about a month before dropping, do not recall dosage or notable changes.

Bupropion 300mg XL tablets in September 2023, also stopped using after about a month. Seemed effective about a week in.

Mother takes medication for anxiety and depression.",N/A,Yes,"Not currently.","Not that I know of.","Currently live in an apartment in a suite with 3 other people, sharing a kitchen and common area. I have a room to myself, however it is quite small.","Mother and father had separated for at least a year up until the loss of father to melanoma back in 2013 (when I was 10). Family (mother, brother) live back at home in Texas, in the house that my father used to own.","Father likely had Asperger's syndrome, however there wasn't much dysfunction prior to the fighting that led up to the separation.","I would generally describe myself to be an honest and well-meaning person, always trying to be as diplomatic as possible if any conflicts occur between myself and/or friends. I have also been described to be a tenacious person, being able to perform and remain stoic in spite of the difficulties I had faced (though, lately it is harder to believe that). I also used to be very ambitious in spite of the procrastination, often over-achieving in high-school academics and trumpet playing, and may likely have been a quality that helped me get to a pre-doctoral student position where I am today.","I have always been more of a reserved / reclusive person, though I usually manage to maintain a few friends that I meet throughout school, however I do not hang out with them much.

Online, I have been able to open up a lot more in the past year and make friends somewhat easily now. However, simultaneously there has also been a lot of conflict in the past year surrounding some close friends that had demanded the majority of my attention during the summer, that ultimately culminated in a friend group dissolving.","Relationship with my current partner of about one year has been very loving and relatively stable. However, I still occasionally experience some episodes of slight paranoia / fear that some mutual friends may be trying to take my partner away from me.","Regrettably, the vast majority of my time is spent binging YouTube or obsessively trying to keep up with online friends via Discord. It is primarily the method in which I try to 'numb' myself / procrastinate with as it is extremely easily accessible. I would estimate at least 8-10 hours a day total.",No,"Northeastern University, 2nd year graduate student","I am currently starting my second year as a pre-doctoral student at Northeastern studying Computer Engineering. I currently work part-time as a research assistant, funded by my PI that I had met as a professor for a class I took during my time as an undergraduate student at the same school. Currently, the procrastination / aversion to working has created some tension as I have been stalling on seemingly trivial tasks for several weeks or even months, but no matter what I am assigned I find it extremely difficult to even start a task.","I have always been somewhat of a lethargic person, easily distracted or otherwise troubled with staying focused. The issue of procrastination and ""pain"" of work has been an (unaddressed) issue since 5th grade, being a constant cycle of stress for virtually every assignment I have been given. As a result, I had become accustomed to ""cutting corners"" where applicable, to try and reduce the time and effort needed to complete the tasks given. However, this obviously clashes with ambition, and makes a research-heavy environment (PhD) extremely difficult as tasks and deadlines are a lot more open-ended. I worry that success would be virtually impossible with this pattern of behavior.

I also struggle a lot with nihilistic thoughts, which become especially pervasive when the stress of work begins to overwhelm me.

Supression of my identity through little comments and dismissals, rejections, reprimands and disaproval throughout my life everyday until it turned into trauma and resulted in me supressing my emotions, thoughts and feelings, like there wasn't enough space for me in my family, no space or place to express how I felt or being able to express myself. Felt ignored and trapped. Parents stricter about where I could go didn't have as much freedom to explore  freely. explore my identity and be independent. Weren't allowed to express my anger, irratibility and discontentment.

Deep sense of rejection and` fear and aswell a overflow of supressed emotions that are now coming out, and unhealth attachment styles and heavy masking .  It felt like there was no space to just be. In my family there's almost no diagnosis on mental health problems but I know many of them both dad and moms side have it. the only very known one is my uncle having depression and i know both of my parents have trauma due to their childhoods ubringing and life.","I have a big heart and am naturally a kind person.

At least nothing that really affects my day to day life anymore.","the biggest one is a hard time getting out of bed and staying out of bed probably because I just don't care about anything in the morning. and I have a very hard time being in empty time that I don't have anything I really should specifically be doing. I also sometimes find myself very unfeeling towards others or situations that should be more important to me",no,,"I cant fall asleep without certain conditions usually. It needs to be as dark as possible and generally completely silent. and there aren't other people awake or active in the house. I have a hard time napping at all. and generally if I cant fall asleep its because something has caused my brain to be racing through certain scenarios over and over again this especially happens as my brain invents a follow up event to something that has happened recently and I try to predict and prepare for possibilities in the future. most nights I wake up at some point in the night the worst nights I can wake up and be actively awake up to like 5 to 10 times just waiting for the alarm to go off so I stop trying to sleep.","I really enjoy psychology I plan to study it in college and probably one day be a psychologist or maybe psychiatrist. I have listened to lectures and stuff. I really enjoy music though it isn't necessarily very therapeutic all the time. I have always been a religious person I have grown up and active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and am now serving a 2 year proselytizing mission.

I really enjoyed though my speech and debate team. right now though I am on the mission so those are limited. I also enjoyed reading a lot I read a lot of very long books in short amounts of time. And I enjoy magic the gathering","don't think so no","I currently live with my missionary companion. previously i lived with my mom dad two sisters and brother and more recently my grandpa.","I moved once when I was in freshman year of high school from Arizona to Utah it was good move though.","my parents have always been very involved in my life and had very high expectations. My parents struggled a lot in their marriage especially when I was younger they yelled and argued. they have gotten better in a lot of ways more recently. I believe my mom probably has untreated depression linked with anger issues. My dad is in the military and was deployed to the middle east for about a year twice in my life. both me and my brother have ichthyosis and it has affected our self esteem a lot I think it may have affected me a little more than him he is a very social friendly kid and I was a very lonely kid. I remember at school in recess I had the habit of sitting under the playground and playing with woodchips until recess was over.","I think I have developed some specific traits that have helped me a lot. I am a very intellectually focused person. I have learned how to speak publicly and socially which is not a skill I was naturally gifted with. I think I have a very good intuition for understanding people and their minute details especially socially. I can analyze anyone's interactions and understand their point of view and goals. I am especially good at figuring out specific traits of people and linking them to a predicted history. basically I love to psycho analyze people. I also am very good because of that of being the best person for whoever I am around. I have very little interest in material or money and I think that's a good thing I like experiences and knowledge.","I'm really bad at initiating friendships. my best friends adopted me when I was unwilling to make friends at a new school I would have been willing to remain basically friendless. once I have a relationship I can retain it fairly easily. until I stop trying then it ends because I end it at least in romantic relationships.","I have a very obsessive phase in any romantic relationship where I use the knowledge and skills I have to be the best for that person. and then it quiets and it is normal for a while and usually it loses the spark it had and I cut it off. which makes me feel like a horrible person because I want it to end and she doesn't.

I have two therapists who think I have ADHD and one who doesn't. My brother has autism and I feel I might be very lightly on that spectrum as well. I mask really well and have trouble connecting to my feelings so it's hard for me to know which part is me and which isn't. I have some trauma as well that might have resulted in some PTSD and I would be interested in exploring that as well. I just want to know what to focus on to get better.","Best friend was murdered by her father when she was 16. We were very close, she lived with me for a summer when she was having issues with her father. 

Narcissistic abuse from a 10 year relationship with my ex-husband, I know everybody throws this word around but he really was. I was always eager to please but it became debilitating while I was with him, lost sight of who I was and even after years of therapy I struggle with boundaries, self-criticism, overemphasis on other people's feelings.

Unwanted medically necessary hysterectomy with complications at 37 (2022), followed by 4 egg retrievals due to significant infertility, then another surgery because I somehow virgin mary-ed another fibroid even though they took all my fibroid generating organs. 6 surgeries in 6 months, two major. Also I was going through a traumatic breakup at the time while all of my friends were having children. It was awful. I had been in therapy for 6 years by this point and I think I dealt with it as well as I could, I had good tools by then, but it was difficult.","I do not have mood concerns. Under the social category, I don't like socializing at parties, even with friends - small talk is excruciating without another activity, to the point I'll leave if there is nothing else to do. I recently went to a baby shower where they had a table of baby blocks to paint and I spent the whole time happily painting while talking to people. If I had to sit around the pool and just chat, I would have quickly left. At work I also struggle with small talk, I am social and everyone likes me but I want to talk about work. I sometimes politely stand there waiting for people to stop talking about BS so I can ask a question about work. Also, I feel much more comfortable 1:1 for some reason in social situations. I do have groups I do fine in - D&D, book club, board game tournaments - but we have something we are doing.","I've fainted a couple of times from vaccinations and egg retrieval medicines, but I woke up quickly when roused.",,"White noise, woken at the slightest thing. I have sprinklers at my condo that go off at midnight; no matter how tightly I shut my windows or how loud I make my noise machine, I wake up enraged at midnight. Also can't sleep through birdsong or snoring. I have separate rooms from my partners when I've lived with them.","Therapy, self help books and podcast, meditation and mindfulness (HUGELY helpful to me), healthy behaviors like exercise, healthy eating, socializing. My cat is not a registered emotional support animal but he helps me so much, he probably should be. All are helpful. 

As for medication, I have sinuses that don't drain well I often take Sudafed for. I realized it basically removes whatever my problem is so I sometimes take it when I have a focus task I'm unable to perform (writing, Powerpoint decks for work.)","Therapist with psychotherapy emphasis, Dr Joel Harms in Michigan. I've been seeing him since 2018 when my ex husband and I went in for marriage counseling. He helped me so much.

New therapist is Cassie Seidler with Walk Intuit in California, only seen her once

Psychiatrist is Kristi Lebesco, Nurse Practitioner with Progeny Psychiatric in California, only seen her once","No, never taken any",No,No,"Sudafed to help me focus, CBD (not with THC, I tried it once and it was horrible) to help me sleep if I'm having a bad night

Nasal polyps, ipatropium bromide and flonase","My mom definitely has some issues but she would never see a doctor for it. I would guess autism spectrum. Brother has been diagnosed with autism and ADHD",Rude,"Yes, I was gifted and met all my milestones ahead of time, or so my mother says","Two D&D groups, 3 book clubs, one writer's group, boyfriend, political activism with Citizen's Climate Lobby",No,"Me and my beloved cat","Moved to MI in 2008, Divorce in 2018, Moved to CA in 2020, lived 7 different places between 2020 and 2024 but I'm finally settled (ex-husband, solo in MI apartment, parent's house during Covid, own place in CA, boyfriend's place in CA, boyfriend & I bought together, we broke up and I moved back in with my parents, then bought my own place).","My mom is extremely insecure and critical of herself and others. She is also very kind and sweet. it's confusing. My brother and I have talked a lot about how whatever is wrong with us probably started there. He 'fights' and I 'fawn' to survive the criticism. She has actually worked on it and improved a little, but she sees the world in black and white terms and can't let anyone else have their own opinions. Her way is right and she won't ever let go of anything. She insults people in all social situations, as an adult I've been shocked at her behavior and had to apologize for it, realizing she's always like that. She just won't ever drop anything. Brother was ADHD, ODD, autistic, very difficult child but as an adult I feel like ""I get it"", I had a hard enough time with my mom and it must have been impossible for him. He is unable to work due to his issues and I'm thankful I'm able to cope for the most part.

No alcoholism or drugs to my knowledge. My whole family are extremely conservative Christians so they don't touch anything (that's a whole other pile of damage, I'm an athiest now but wasn't until my twenties.)","Hardworking, virtuous, caring, encouraging, empathetic, loving, smart, funny","I didn't until 2018 when I started learning about boundaries and finding my own sense of self. I lost some friends during that process - people who mostly wanted me to agree with them. Ex husband, two old friends (I still have many very old friends who love both the old and new me.)

I don't have drama in relationships except when they end like the above ones, and even those were like, one phone call and one e-mail exchange. I'm a pretty excellent communicator and I know how to gently and lovingly convey a boundary when I need to and also respect others' feelings and preferences.","Limited relationship experience due to conservative upbringing, I've only had 3. 2 years, 10 years, 3 years. I think I have overcome most of my codependence. These days I'm kind of on the other side, if anything, difficult trusting and opening up. For two years I went on a lot of first dates and didn't like anyone.  I am now with someone I've been with for 6 months and we're doing OK.

Interestingly, the people I've had the most significant relationships with both had diagnosed OCD - ex husband had hoarding/paranoid OCD and a 3 year relationship after my divorce had more of the 'checking' OCD and repetitive motions (pacing, blinking, skipping cracks, etc.)","Not much, I am pretty intentional and careful about social media.

I am learning about setting boundaries and how to not be a people-pleaser so much that I am miserable.  My therapist has mentioned I may have ASD or ADHD so I would like to explore that possibility.

I am very involved with my Unitarian Universalist church. It's mostly volunteer run and I have several crucial jobs such as treasurer and handy person.","Yes.
I have seen an occupational therapist for problems in my wrist.
I have seen a physical therapist for many problems but most recently hip instability. I have some degree of hyper mobility.","I live with my husband of 31 years and daughter who is 23 years old. We have a 2-story, 3-bedroom house with a back yard.","During Covid pandemic, my son also lived at home and the 4 of us just sat around the house all day. My son got a full-time job and moved out and my husband retired. All of us in the house do not work so we just sit around the house all day.","My parents were raised to believe that girls should be sweet and they should aspire to have a family someday. Once I started having boyfriends, my parents became even more controlling and they were terrified that I might want to get physical with the boys. I did want to have privacy when I was with my boyfriends so it created an environment of sneaking and distrust. I just wanted some freedom but they needed to know everything. My mom became sick with COPD/emphysema when I was in 8th grade and I needed to watch out for her. When I started to drive, they bought me a car so I could drive her around. They put me on their checking account so I could run errands for the family. Everything was good when I was in service to them and making them proud.","I am a friendly, positive person. I know how to do things like make repairs around the house, woodworking, rehabbing furniture, painting, organizing, and decorating. I strive to be seen as capable, responsible, and highly intelligent.","I have trouble maintaining friendships but it is more to do with my lack of awareness for social expectations. I might think of friendships as contractual, each of us having a complimentary contribution to the other. For example, I like friends who are a bit more outgoing because I am introverted.","Codependence was the hallmark of my dating experience. I was always on the hunt for a life partner. I wanted to find ""the one."" I forgot to have fun because I wanted to be in a serious relationship. I was very interested in physical intimacy but my parents made me feel it was wrong. As a young adult, I was very promiscuous and took some risks. I had a couple of great long-term partners. Once I got married I realized I have no chemistry with my husband so sex is a thing of the past.","Perhaps 4 hours a day on Facebook. In addition to the usual feed, I am on a Buy Nothing Group, some support groups for cancer, decorating groups, groups for my interest in music and rabbits. I often browse through items for sale on Facebook Marketplace.","I filled out the Berkshire form for Kaiser Permanente.",,"I was a good student through high school. Undergrad was difficult because I had little self-discipline and didn't study well. I was distracted by wanting to spend time with boys. Somehow I managed to get a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. I went on to get a two-year Master's Degree in Psychology.","I am a very lucky person. I have stability, I am safe. My family is frustrated by my inability to keep the house clean. My husband says that if I really loved him, I wouldn't have clutter. He doesn't understand that I can't do things even when I want to. My mind is active, and very noisy, all day every day. I want to have a clean house but I can't figure out where things should go. I get a thrill from acquiring things, and this leads to clutter.

Pre-kids, I didn't have trouble staying asleep, but sometimes struggle to fall asleep. We use a white noise machine. I don't take melatonin or sleep medication. If my thoughts are racing before bed, I listen to a sleep story or meditation from the Calm app. Now that I have two kids, my sleep is very disjointed. I'm still breastfeeding my baby and he's currently waking a couple times a night, so I start my mornings tired.","I have read many self-help books. I did about a year of talk therapy with a psychologist the year after graduating college (2014-2015) and stopped when I moved and generally felt better anyway.

They would say terrible things to each other, slam and lock doors, throw dishes, etc. Most fights stemmed from my dad's infidelity. My parents loved us though and were both involved in our upbringing. They did have high expectations of us, though, which I think was the root of a lot of my perfectionistic tendencies growing up.

No official diagnoses that I'm aware of, but growing up my parents told me that my dad was prone to addiction. I was told he had an alcohol problem and cut it out. He did do a lot of drugs as a high schooler at least too. My mom most likely has some mental health issues, but not sure exactly what.

My dad was repeatedly unfaithful to my mom growing up, which I think caused some trust issues.

Currently, I am struggling with emotional regulation with him - quickly getting annoyed and overwhelmed in relatively minor disagreements. I also have very low interest in sex and intimacy is hit or miss. I think being postpartum is making this worse. I don't feel at my best mentally or physically, am prioritizing sleep, and also often feel ""touched out"" from taking care of the kids that I don't feel like physical touch from him.","I really dislike how I feel using social media.

I occassionally get sucked into Facebook, which I feel like I need to have to see my daughter's daycare pictures and family updates, but I've cut out Instagram. I ocassionally go on LinkedIn and YouTube, but don't have an emotional reaction on there. I don't like how much time I spend on TikTok, but I go on it sometimes to pass the time breastfeeding. I should watch a show or do something else instead. If I read, I worry I might fall asleep by accident.

occupational or relational impairment","i haven't been very good at therapy my past. i need help with focus, procrastination, motivation etc. i just get very unorganized and stressed and anxious about everything and then i get depressed because i feel like im not good enough.","i have trauma with sexual abuse. this is more recent, it happened when i was 19. it comes back in flashbacks sometimes, but i do my best to block it out.","i down normally get out of bed. i stay in bed all day if i can. i have trouble sleeping. i do have mood swings pretty frequently still. i also get excessively angry if im overstimulated. i am usually quite irritable, but ive become better at hiding that from the people around me. i also have a very large problem with overthinking and anxiety.","ive had two

ago.","Emotional over eating","i take melatonin to sleep. i have a lot of struggles with falling asleep. i stay up super late and sleep into the day because my thoughts just keep me up literally every night. the melatonin only works sometimes. i also sometimes put on asmr or the thunder and ocean sounds to sleep.","ive tried meditation, yoga and exercise. it doesn't help much. doing tarot readings for people and or myself usually helps me calm down and come back to my energy center. going on long drives with the windows down and the music loud also helps sometimes. smoking weed works for me sometimes too.","ive seen a good amount of therapists and i didn't really like any of them. i don't remember their names its been a while. i currently see a psychiatrist Dr. Gurvinder Arora.","ive been on topamax, amitriptyline and fluoxetine. its been so long that ive been on these medications that i don't remember the dosages. i was on all of those for my migraines and also my anxiety and depression. i feel like all of those medications made me have more issues. i am currently on lamotrigine 225mg for bipolar disorder.","i used to have bad mania at times but im on lamictal now and it doesn't happen as often.","not severe symptoms no.","yes i smoked week consistently for all of high school and about half of the year after graduation. i used it for literally everything. i stopped smoking because i greened out really bad and had paranoia and felt sick. this happened in december of 2022. i didn't smoke weed again up until recently. i only do it occasionally now when im very stressed and can't stop thinking/ can't sleep. i also vape and have been vaping since i was 16 on and off.","i was previously diagnosed with depression, anxiety and chronic migraine disorder. i was on topamax, amitriptyline and fluoxetine for that. i stopped taking medication for that right before i turned 17. i felt that it was making my anxiety worse. it was a concern i had brought up with my neurologist multiple times and she wouldn't listen so i just slowly stopped taking it on my own. i am now on lamotrigine 225 mg for bipolar disorder.","my dad was diagnosed with anxiety. i feel like it might be something more than that. a few of my aunts on my dads side have anxiety, my cousin on my dads side has dyslexia and another cousin on my dads side has chronic migraines. my moms cousin has bipolar and his kids have autism. there's also anxiety and depression on my moms side of the family.","ive never had children.","yes i was actually advanced.","im in a music group with my school,

i argued a lot for a few years. it ended up getting pretty bad but he's pretty chill now. i feel like my dad is probably undiagnosed bipolar but im not a professional so i can't say for sure. ive lived in the same house my entire life. my uncle lived with me for a period of time but i was pretty young when that happened. nobody in my family has committed suicide. some members on my moms side has had some drug addiction issues.","i love very deeply. i have good music taste. im pretty talented, i sing, paint, draw and act. i have good communication skills i don't normally shy away from hard conversations. im very smart i used to do well in school. i retain academic information very well if im engaged enough on the subject. im a good friend and i care a lot about the people in my life. im very personable and charismatic. im very funny and im good with animals.","ive been surrounded by a lot of drama. it was a big issue growing up but since graduation ive made a solid stable friend group. we have our issues here and there but were locked in. im content with the people i have. i don't usually have the desire to make new friends.","im not very good at regulating my emotions when im in romantic relationships. ive noticed that it doesn't matter who im dating, i get very anxious and high maintenance because i always think there's something wrong or that im the problem. almost every partner ive been with has said that they ""can't trust me"" for some reason or another. i personally think its ridiculous because im very loyal and i don't do anything that would constitute distrust. im very good at having sex that's usually what inclines people to stay attached to me. honestly i feel like im quite unforgettable in relationships. i go above and beyond for my partners

My mom's behavior and thought process was bizarre at times-- later on I found out that she was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and she became very mean and out of touch with reality sometimes. Dad worked a lot, traveled a lot internationally for work. Oldest sister with depression and anxiety, and middle brother with non-verbal autism. I was the youngest, felt pressure to be easy-going / high achieving to get attention.","Kind, nurturing, supportive.","Nervous to meet new people sometimes, often wait for someone else to talk first to feel out the situation and wait to see how comfortable I will be before jumping in. I sometimes over-think social situations, ex if someone isn't responding quickly enough or hanging out enough, I worry about bothering them by being too pushy.","Husband and I started dating in college at age 18. Relationship has been more stressful since having kids, I think in common way unfortunately -- I feel that household responsibilities are unbalanced, I feel frustrated when I do more.

Highest degree I got was Masters and then Post-Masters certificate.","My therapist brought up question of neurodiversity.

difficulty staying with one train of thought - with qualifications to be discussed as related to recent med.","Covid. It was difficult for all of us of course. I had a nervous breakdown around my kids' return to school / fear that they would get sick and die.","Motivation, getting out of bed in the morning (typically 2 min before my first meeting and 2 minutes late to the meeting). 

Isolating, getting to sleep / staying asleep.","No head injuries. I think I did have a head MRI recently to look at my inner ear.","Emotional over eating","If I go to sleep when I feel the ""signal"" to do so, that would mean going to sleep at like 8-9, then I'd be up at like 11, 12, 1, and not able to get back to sleep. Pushing through that 8-9 sleepiness and staying up later, I recognize sleep signals from my body at appropriate times. 

I quickly habituate to melatonin. 
Hydoxyzine does nothing -- this statement requires further refinement to be discussed.

I've found one particular cannabis strain that is helpful for getting to sleep and staying asleep with minimal unwanted side effects. More on this in the recreational drugs section, as I don't have a medical card.","Meditation:
- During times of for-no-reason episodes of anxiety and existential dread (starting anywhere from lunch time to late afternoon / early evening, depending on my state of medication and my degree of situational depression, I would often find the need to leave me desk during the workday and lie down.
- I attempt to meditate during these times, and I'm probably somewhat successful, but it is much more difficult and I think less effective than when I used to mediate during high school and college.

Prescriptions:
- phentermine 37.5mg 
-- accidentally treated depression and ADD symptoms
-- originally prescribed for weight loss, of course
-- this medication seemed to be quite effective but maybe we can do better; I'll be happy to discuss this in detail

OTC supplements:
- St John's Wort: marginally effective, but noticeable. Does noticeably help bolster a therapeutically insufficient bupropion dose. Seems to improve mood, but not focus.

- L-Theanine: Seems to improve focus, mostly.

- Tumeric: Efficacy not clear.

- L-Tyrosine: Suggested by my Atrius psych. Does nothing if taken during the day. Seems to bolster next day neurotransmitter levels if I take it in the evening.

Exercise:
- Have tried numerous times to start regular aerobic exercise, but low-to-absent motivation has prevented me from establishing a consistent habit of this.
 - I have, however, managed to *always* do PT and OT exercises to address recovery from tibial plateau fracture and to prevent nerve damage from spinal stenosis and carpal tunnel
-- These are easier to keep up on than aerobic exercise, because they can be done in small chunks
-- Also, my motivation to do them is that I'm terrified of losing full use of my limbs as I see in my father who is in his 80s. I have many creative interests I want to pursue now and even more in retirement, and they all involve use of my hands/arms.
-- My PT and OT therapists love me for this.
-- So I can keep these up even in the lowest times, but doing aerobic exercise on top of that has been a bridge too far.

psilocybin:
- A couple times over the years I have done 3-4 month long microdosing protocols
--  the first of these was incredibly beneficial in helping me break out of my worst period of alcohol abuse
-- the second one was a couple years later during a time of unusual stress at work, sometime during covid, but I forget when exactly.
- And lately I occasionally use it in sub-perceptual doses for cases of acute anxiety. Such cases are rare, but I was glad to have it available during the cannabis detox period between the ADD interview and the in person test.
- I do not use this regularly for anxiety, keeping it only for emergencies.","I am currently seeing Eric Gibson:
781-875-3263
egibsonlicsw@gmail.com","wellbutrin - 300mg helped my depression symptoms but not adequately; did not address ADD aspects.
-- 22-Sep-2022: Started bupropion SR 150mg twice daily. Very slightly improved mood, increased ability to work through the day / reduced need for 30-90 minute  meditation breaks during work day. Stopped taking bupropion around beginning of May 2023, mostly due to excessive sweating particularly from the back of the head.
-- 05-Jul-2024: Started taking bupropion XL 150mg once daily when my PCP stopped my phentermine prescription. PCP did not give instructions to increase dose after 3-4 as is conventionally done.
-- 07-Aug-2024: Started taking bupropion XL 300mg. Slight improvement to depression symptoms since then

phentermine - 17-May-2023 - 05-Jul-2024
- Taking 37.5 mg of phentermine for weight loss (then stopping it) led to my diagnosis with ADD. phentermine seemed to treat both my depression and ADD(I) fairly well, but this is a topic for debate that we should discuss in detail. There may be a case that phentermine put me into the ADD(H) zone, which for a self-aware adult may be manageable with behavioral strategies.
 
Note on side effects: 
I have experienced zero adverse side effects from taking phentermine. It made me feel calm, in control of my thoughts and emotions, able to focus, etc. And during the time when I was still taking this med and my last big situational depression factor at work resolved, I started feeling time-appropriate signals from my body to sleep, usually 10:30-11:30 at night. Getting to sleep was easy, as it was easy to control my thoughts, I did not have persistent ongoing negative self-discourse. I could either quiet my mind and go to sleep, or I could let my mind knock around creative ideas and still get off to sleep. During this time it was also easy to get back to sleep if I woke up during the night, and I got out of bed early each morning feeling happy and refreshed, ready to face the day whatever it might bring, good or bad.

Note on cessation of prescription:
My PCP asserted that she was stopping my phentermine prescription because it ""was not working"" for weight loss (except that it WAS actually working) and because of a claim of concern about my blood pressure while continuing the medication. However it turns out that notion that phentermine raises blood pressure is purely anecdotal. There are no peer reviewed studies that have found phentermine to raise blood pressure, and there is in fact this study which found that it lowered blood pressure:
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2011.94","There is some debate about whether I was possibly hypomanic when taking a full 37.5mg dose of phentermine and a major very long term (10+ years) aspect of situational depression at my workplace suddenly got resolved. 

My therapist, Eric, confirmed that I was not actually full-manic during this time.","No, but I have thought during this current period of being ""between meds"" that I do not want to live the rest of my life like this, and that is a very hard and anxiety producing thought. 

My PCP stopped my phentermine prescription on 05-Jul-2024, kicking off a now six week long ongoing mental health crisis for me rather than extending it for one more month until I could see a psychiatrist in the Atrius network and start trying conventional ADD meds. 

I'm extremely fortunate that I'm an early stage member of the company I work for. I am employee #4, joined when we were a startup with no business partners signed on yet, and I was one of a handful of people who built most of our software systems from the ground up. So I have a past track record of good performance to buffer this period and a very deep well of institutional knowledge that I can tap into to help other team members while my ability to perform my own independent work is currently compromised. 

If I was a newer employee at a company, I probably would have lost my job by now due to the catastrophically low level of job performance I have had during this period between meds.","Historically my main ""medication"" was alcohol years ago. 

Now it is pretty much replaced with periodic low-level cannabis use, though when I smoke cannabis I tend to have a small amount to drink as an accessory to that ritual.

I've found that cannabis is much more helpful than alcohol (and far less harmful in moderation) for symptoms such as anxiety, stress-induced muscular tension, inflammation, and sleep assistance. 

My consumption of both alcohol and cannabis are both conscious and controlled, and I aim to keep both at minimal ""therapeutic"" levels. For example, doing into the cannabis ""detox"" period before my recent in person ADD test, the amount I was consuming nightly had been slowly and steadily declining. I learned from my therapist to use these substances consciously and minimally. I can stop either or both at any time without adverse consequences other than trouble sleeping and slightly more depressed mood.","I'm currently (again) taking 300mg of bupropion, prescribed by my PCP when she cut off my phentermine prescription. Since it promotes (some of) the same neurotransmitters as phentermine, bupropion made getting off phentermine slightly less terrible than the fist time I stopped it (which I did try to titrate down over two weeks, and it was still absolutely awful). But of course bupropion is slow to ramp up, so this whole time has sucked to varying degrees.","Nothing formally diagnosed.",n/a,yes,"If I were feeling good such activities would include:
- Ceramic art
- Woodworking
- Metalworking/welding
- Playing guitar (this one particularly hurts, I've neglected it so long)
- Gardening
- UU church
- ""men's group"" at the church (community service group)
- high school robotics team
- frisbee 
- tennis
- cycling

I used to play video games, but when I recognized that they were an addictive behavior and interfering with other important things in my life I stopped.","Not sure.","- My wife, close to the same age, just a little over a year older than me
- Older son: Starting his third year at Berklee in the fall
- Younger son: Starting his first year at BU in the fall","During the short period I was feeling my full self I started making a plan to visit one of my college professors to thank him personally as one of the most important influences in my life. I learned however that he died in August of 2023, so I missed being able to see him again and thank him by a year, because I was not well enough to have the motivation and sociability to develop this plan and put it into action.

This news hit me very hard, as the loss of a family member. It was similar to when my stepfather died suddenly and unexpectedly of a ""widow maker"" heart attack when i was 20 years hold, home on break from college. He was the father to me that my biological father never was, and my grief and this event was mighty and intense. But of course nobody in my immediate family was there to see that, as it was 6-7 years before I met my wife.

So she and my kids have never seen me grieve for the unexpected death of a family member (only slow deaths like cancer), and since I was feeling ""good"" at this point in time, I was able to feel and process the full strength of this emotion, which was alarming to them as ""normal"" people. This is probably a good topic for discussion.

At work, I was railroaded into change of position during my recent brief medicated/happy/whole-self period. The executive leadership at this company are mostly terrible in various ways, this being one of them. Feeling as good I was, I felt a proper sense of agency, and I set an expectation that I would define a new role for myself. But unfortunately I was not able to complete this process due to be blindsided by the sudden cessation of my phentermine prescription and the resulting diminished state of self / intellectual ability that created. When not feeling well, I shied away from prominent leadership roles. I've been in leadership roles the whole time at this company, but quiet ones, leading from the side. Feeling well, I wanted to be in a proper leadership role, highly visible and higher in the organization hierarchy than I am now.","- parents were divorced when I was 10
- co parenting arrangement
- my dad made sure that this was as miserable as possible for everyone involved
- Among the various indignities my dad threatened my mom with gun, and I've learned just recently that the threatened to kill my stepfather and his entire family -- something my mom obviously protected my sister and myself from knowing when we were younger.
- my mom recently confirmed that my dad was abusing alcohol during (and based on his behavior some years after) the divorce, which I suspected upon reflection after exiting my own worst times of alcohol abuse.

- my mom did her best to navigate this ongoing terrible atmosphere with grace and dignity
- wonderful stepfather entered my life just before HS
-- he was one of the strongest formative influences in my life, more even than my mother in some ways.
-- we were actually talking about having him legally adopt me at the time when he died.

- my sister has been in therapy for decades, to my knowledge mostly due to issues related to our parents and the divorce
- she claims now to be happier than she ever has been
- but she has no meaningful relationship with either of our parents
- she's just straight up walked away from trying to get our dad into a safer living situation (i.e. assisted living, which he resists stridently, even as some close friends are going that route)
- she will not have anything more than superficial small talk with our mom, which Mom is acutely aware of and deeply troubled by
- And while we've had a close relationship in the past, even living together in Boston after college, I seem to be on the ""superficial"" list now
- Oh, and she gets upset at things that I do/say (that nobody else in the room thinks to be noteworthy, problematic, or offensive in any way) and then calls me up months later in tears telling me how much I hurt and offended her by these things (none of which were even directed at her)
- I'm really worried about her.","creativity, kindness and compassion and empathy (when feeling well myself), logical thinking / analysis, spatial and mechanical reasoning, artistic/aesthetic sense, neuroplasticity, really good taste in music.","All of the relationships in which I have difficulty involve serious unresolved baggage:

My sister (profound, unresolved, and frankly mysterious since she is so closed)

My dad: he's got a lot of baggage and emotional vulnerabilities, but I have to give him credit that deep down he is good at heart. We have had multiple serious schisms, but he has always eventually opened back up again, and we have reconciled. Ask me about the latest one.

My wife and my younger son: 
- Both I believe have trauma from the time I was most severely abusing alcohol. When challenging discussions are happening, they both seem to act like they are talking to ""me from 7-8 years ago"", not me now. This complicates things.
- Both I believe also have untreated ADD though my younger son was recently diagnosed.
- Both express many typical ADD aspects, which I will not list here, but they seriously complicate communication and lead to lost of misunderstandings, but we get through them.

Outside of those circumstances, I don't have problems with relationships. I keep in touch with a small collection of very close friends from high school and college. I've developed some good friendships with other folks in Scitutate where we have lived for almost 14 years. And I'm pretty close with quite a few people at my workplace, even though they are in Montreal and I am down in MA.

- When I am not feeling well, I don't want to be with other people -- even my own family when feeling the worst as sometimes recently, which hurts even more
- When I am feeling well, I'm quite social and gregarious, and love meeting and talking with new people / making new friends.

Notably: I _did_ have some very serious relationship problems with my older son. These came to a head in his senior year of high school (2021-22). Zack's courage to stand up to me is what precipitated both him and me starting therapy. Mostly separate, though my wife and I did have a few group sessions with Zack. I'm so immensely proud of Zack for his courage, which led to me learning to be a better person and substantially fixing our family. He and I have a great relationship now and no problems communicating.","Historically libio mismatch beween me and my wife. I've learned to safely and privately take care of my needs when she cannot engage with me in that way for whatever reason. I have understood for some time that my high sex drive is likely in large part ""dopamine seeking"" behavior. During my worst period of abusing alcohol I was also uncontrolled and impulsive in this area. I've since learned to moderate this dopamine seeking behavior as well, being sure to maintain my ability to be effectively and pleasantly intimate with my wife.

Interestingly during the recent period that I was feeling well, I did not feel the always near drive to seek sexual gratification, though I still had plenty of interest in and affection for my wife during this time. More incidental expressions of love and affection, but not with a pressing need to escalate it into full-blown sex. But sex was just fine / very good when we did it during this period, and indeed much of that was for it being less urgent from my perspective.","During my recent pivotal period of feeling well, I consciously engaged with social media, on a limited basis. I did this in large part to let my friends know I was still alive / OK, because I had NO draw to it. And after like 15 minutes of FB in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, I would just lose interest in and and go do something more interesting like clean up the workshop.

On youtube I mostly watch reputable news sources and educational videos about woodworking or welding and stuff like that, which I don't so much consider social media. But even then, during the ""well"" period my interest in news via youtube was reduced, and I engaged there much less as well.","Any upcoming or prior testing anywhere else? It is important for us to know this because certain tests can't be repeated in terms of administration within one year of each other or it can render the results invalid.",n/a,"Learning new things both for work and in my personal life is painfully difficult -- much more so in recent years than historically -- due to my difficulty focusing an maintaining concentration on a single topic.","When I was feeling well recently, not only did the ongoing negative self image / discourse stop, but I found myself thinking things like:

""I love my ADD brain""
""I love being Jim""

One from Psychology Today named Rebecca Halloran and then I'm seeing a therapist from Baycove named Hannah. I'm not too sure about her last name as well as when i have started meeting with them both.My memory is awful unfortunately.","I am currently taking 75 of Zoloft, I'm on a 1 multivitamin and I'm taking either 5 or 10 Claritin.

The Zoloft feels more better side effect wise compared to what I was on before that. I was taking Lexapro and that was not fun whatsoever with those side effects feeling very zombie like.","No

I'm very sensitive with sound but that's because of past trauma with my relatives","Not at the moment but I have cut in the past and had planned out to take my life twice.",No,No,"My relatives had a history of Depression, Suicide, Bipolar disorder, Heart issues, Strokes,I'm sure there's more but i'm no longer in contact with them.","NO

Again my memory is awful I have a very hard time remembering the simple things in life.","I am currently living in transitional housing. My older sister and I were kicked out of our hometown back in early 2022 after both our grandparents had passed away in 2021. 

My older sister has since moved out of the housing we resided in while I'm still currently here but am desperately looking to get out as it's not a safe environment for me mentally.","My grandparents both passed in 2021. My grandpa in May and then my grandmother in December. Since their passing things have been hitting too hard and I had gotten worse with my depression. I lost the people that raised me because my actual parents said i was a mistake and didn't want me at 2 weeks old. 

I basically lost my whole world when they left","My parents gave me up to my grandparents when I was just 2 weeks old stating I was a mistake. Depression, Suicide, Bipolar, Drugs, Alcohol and more ran very highly with my family since growing up. It was just something that I saw mostly everyday and night with them.","My strength is being a good listener

I'm not sure what else I'm good at","I have a hard time making new friends mainly because I don't want to and just don't have a lot of trust in people these given days.

I like having a small group around me if I can, It's less drama","Trust with others is definitely not the strongest. I've had two previous relationships first one was whatever then the second one was toxic. I did face some codependency with a friend of mine but have and still am working on getting better away from that.","Not too much if anything I'm mostly on youtube because that's my form of tv. As for things like Instagram and tiktok...I'm not really much on instagram and I don't go anywhere near tiktok.","I did ask another company if they could help with testing but have not yet heard anything or had much luck with them.","Cape Cod Community College","I graduated high school and will be starting my freshman year of college starting September.","I'm very shy but can open up eventually.

as far as mothers side, she comes from an abusive household but only my grandmother is alive to be able to ask about it. my mom has said she would just stay quiet when things were bad. not sure if thats a mental health thing or a self preservation thing. my grandfather was an alcoholic and got pretty bad so theres obviously a deeper issue with him there. my moms brother became a drug addict.

dads side is interesting. my grandmother passed when I was 9 so I don't remember much, my grandfather is still alive but I only see him once a year because he hasn't know how to talk to me and my brother since about the time we started to develop personalities! its almost like he doesn't know how to talk to us any more cause we aren't dolls. not sure if that was the same for my dad as he grew up.","never been pregnant","I believe I did but I dont remember much of preschool-elementary. just blips of regular life here and there",Theater,"I don't believe so","Mom, Dad, 19 year old brother and dog Millie <3","loss of about 8 close relatives over the past 3 years and we are going to lose another in the next year most likely. all 3 of my moms siblings and her dad, my moms cousins husband/my dads best friend, my dads uncle, my moms cousin, and now my moms brothers daughter (her niece) has spinal cancer. the first relative we lost, my moms oldest sibling, my auntie Pam, passed of ovarian cancer. I also lost my pet bunny last year.

I moved out at the end of the year that my moms sister passed and was out of the house for 2 years. I then moved back in almost 2 years ago now. This caused I big shift in our household.","this is actually a huge current struggle for me. i'm constantly fighting with myself and wondering if they are the problem or if its me. or maybe its a crazy combo of both. one of my earliest homework memories are of my dad helping me with a page that had a small story and you had to fill in the blanks with the right words. it was super simple first grade words and all I needed was to understand what words went where. well, I crossed a word off of the word bank too messily or dark or something and my dad said ""no, you do it like this"" and took my pencil and erased my little scribble and did one solid swipe across the word. he erased it again and gave the pencil back and my little brain didn't like that you could still see the word with just the one line so I scribbled it out again. now me being a CHILD I didn't know I was doing anything wrong other than I just wanted to do it my way. for what was probably 10 minutes, but felt like a life time, my dad kept screaming and erasing my scribble and telling em to do it again. he wouldn't let me move on till I did it his way. I remember being in tears most nights doing home work. I remember there being nights when I was either a young teen/teen where it would be 11pm and my dad and I would be having a screaming match and I could think about is omg this is so bad the neighbors can probably hear us. I remember thinking that many many nights of my childhood. but was I the problem? I cant remember what a lot of the fights were about the they were probably stupid. 

when they weren't upset though, they were there for me. they have seen every single show and musical that i've been in, they've made me costumes and helped build sets. they've got to the store with me last minute because I had a project due the next day that I procrastinated. my mom has held me through some of my saddest moments throughout school. 

since coming home after I moved back in 2022, our relationship has completely disappeared. fights constantly to the point where I just try and stay in my room, but even that is an issue cause now i'm not an active member of the household. my mom has called me a drama queen, dramatic, and even narcissistic. she's said ""Lauren's always the victim isn't she."" they've threatened to kick me out but then never do, they've taken away the car that i've used since they purchased it from my aunts neighbor in 2018 and then given it back after 6 months. Only for my dad to take it away again cause he didn't see proof that I was putting 30% of my paycheck at my job into my 401k. and when I brought up to him that the 30% was really holding me back and I like to have a little more money to work with in my paycheck, he said ""thats not your money"" cause I guess I owe them for going away to college for a year or something.

neither of my parents use drugs or even drink. my dad will maybe a have a beer a few times a week but never more than one or two and its not that often. my mom doesn't like the taste. she also has family history of drug addicts and alcoholics so has steered clear of that. she has said i'm ""just like my druggie uncle"" for smoking some pot. I don't really drink either, just maybe a drink at a restaurant or holidays/special occasions. im not a druggie and will never be one. addictions scare me.","I am caring and thoughtful. when I love, I love deeply. Im always considerate of people around me, or at least I try my best to be. I try to go through life with a smile because you never know the kind of day someone is having. if I can brighten their day, my day is brighter because of it.","I thought I had friends in school but looking back I was never really close to any of them. summers were spent with my brother and cousin cause my ""friends"" never reached out. but the school year was spent chatting away but no hangouts after school. the occasional large group movie trip or birthday party was planned and I was invited to those, but never small or one on one. there are two exceptions to this. my kindergarten-now friend and my friend who got me into theater that I met in second grade. I was always closer with them than the others and I still check in on them to this day. they are the only two who didn't drop me at the end of my senior year right before prom. I made one friend in my one year away at college and we still check in on each other from afar but other than that I struggle. it wasn't until this year that i've made some new theater friends and got into a relationship again after almost 2 years. I want to make friends, I just always feel like my social struggles and insecurities make it so difficult.","its hard cause its another one of those ""were they the problem or me or both"" situations. my first relationship I was bad. when I was upset I would shut down and stop talking or walk away. when we broke up I immediately recognized that that was not healthy and I have been working on my communication since. im now at a point where im affraid I over communicate or something. my last relationship used to tell me ""nothing is ever enough for you"" or "" I can never make you happy"" because I would bring up things that were bothering me. but in my current relationship I am reassured that its ok to bring things up when they are bothering me and that he would rather have that then me keep it all inside. 

before my current boyfriend, as I was dating, I noticed I would open up very easily. but I wouldnt realize till after the date the amount of info I would spew at them. so ive been learning to keep somethings closer to the heart I guess.

I also struggle with sex. im not sure if its an adhd or depression thing but climaxing is so difficult. its not that its the wrong person or it doesnt feel good, its like its a brain thing. I want it, it feels great, it just so hard to get there! pretty much every partner ive had gets worn out by me.","when i'm working I don't have access to my phone but when Im home i'm either watching youtube, video chatting my boyfriend or friends, checking facebook and instagram pretty infrequently (mostly to rid of app notifications and make sure I haven't missed anything important like invites or messages) but thats probably once a day maybe","I was tested for ADHD in 2022 and diagnosed with it. its was a solo test for adhd alone.",,"I got my diploma from amesbury high school and did one year away at Hofstra university in the Drama department. I came home to switch to education at a community college and then covid happened and screwed me up. I didn't do well for about a year and almost failed out of the school. but I went back and took one class at a time and was getting A's again. I have since stopped however because I no longer wish to pursue a college degree like my parents want, but a certification in medical esthetician work. i've always been ""smart but doesn't apply herself"" or ""extremely chatty"" or ""has to be redirected frequently."" the chattiness has slowed but not really. I just mask a lot now. sometimes im afraid to speak now because of how often I was told to stop growing up","I would like to be tested to see if I fall into the spectrum of Autistic/AuDHD. as well as CPTSD/other due to amount of loss and the whiplash of emotions I have experienced over my lifetime. If BPD or Bipolar are noticed, id like to look into that as well. I just really want to find the correct diagnosis so I can start to work on myself in ways that are appropriate for me, not the neuro-typical society.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5994661342321448297/5994661342321448297_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5994661342321448297/5994661342321448297_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5994661342321448297/5994661342321448297_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5994661342321448297/5994661342321448297_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5994661342321448297/5994661342321448297_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5994661342321448297/5994661342321448297_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5994661342321448297/5994661342321448297_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5994661342321448297/5994661342321448297_base64_75_1723656935.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5994661342321448297/5994661342321448297_base64_76_1723656936.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

I can’t find things i need often even if i was the one that put it somewhere
I feel stressed, overwhelmed, and exhausted all the time
Constantly forget things that i need to do 
I hardly finish anything that i start (hobbies, projects)
Every task feels exhausting, overwhelming even if it won’t take that long to do (dishes, putting away laundry, cleaning up clutter)
I get obsessive about something I get interested in.. will watch a lot of youtube videos daily, internet search, feel the need to buy everything needed for it, and completely dive in until i want nothing to do with it
When doing or buying something on a whim I only think of what i could gain from it and do not like to be told the possible negatives
I don’t like to be told to do anything, it makes me not want to do it even if i was planning on doing it.
When talking on the phone with my mother, I change topics constantly. Completely unrelated topics.
When I have some kind of appointment or meeting or anything that involves other people or going somewhere… I think about it until it happens. I have trouble doing anything the whole day. I feel the need to prepare, tidy up the house, and obsessively think/worry about what will happen during the appointment, what might be said.
 I will worry about small things like “what if I can’t find a parking spot” or “What if it's hard to get to”. 
I will put off meetings or appointments if possible even if I have the whole day free. Because I would rather not stress about it or have to deal with it.
When people come over to my house, I obsessively clean until they get there. The whole time they are there I am anxious about my house not being spotless and constantly upset myself in my head when I think they have noticed things that are messy, cluttered, dirty.
Terrible with money, if i want something i feel like i have to have it even if i shouldn’t spend the money.
Sometimes when someone is talking to me, i get lost in the own thoughts and stop listening and then realize while they are talking that i wasn’t listening
Just found out when my brother was visiting from Chicago that he is taking medication for ADD.
When having a conversation with someone I often finish their sentence, to me it's a way of showing that I totally get what they are saying and I'm right there with them, but sometimes it's very frustrating for the person trying to talk.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5988624772529303901/5988624772529303901_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5988624772529303901/5988624772529303901_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5988624772529303901/5988624772529303901_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5988624772529303901/5988624772529303901_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5988624772529303901/5988624772529303901_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5988624772529303901/5988624772529303901_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5988624772529303901/5988624772529303901_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5988624772529303901/5988624772529303901_base64_75_1723053278.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5988624772529303901/5988624772529303901_base64_76_1723053279.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

Autism","lack of motivation
procrastination","What type of therapy to engage in would be insightful. I have been in CBT therapy for the past 5 years (on and off), and would be curious to know if a different method would be more effective. I'm having a hard time staying focused, motivated, and on-task at my remote job, and I'd like to know why it's so difficult for me and what I can do to self-accommodate.","I have a history of religious trauma. It definitely still impacts my life, but not in the ways listed above.","It does take me a while to get out of bed. During the work week, I feel fatigued most of the time. I have been experiencing more mood swings this year since getting off birth control. I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember (I don't think I've ever received a formal diagnosis) and it usually manifests in perfectionism.",No,"Picky eater","I usually get around 9 hours of sleep a night, and I don't have trouble staying asleep. It usually takes a long time for me to fall asleep, and can be challenging to wake up in the morning. I tried melatonin for a while during quarantine, but it didn't always work. I've found weed gummies to be more effective in turning off my brain. I don't use these every night, but depending on my stress levels, it can be up to 4 nights a week.","Therapy, the occasional self help book, podcasts, meditation. I have always enjoyed meditation and yoga, but I have a hard time sticking with it.","I am currently working with a therapist that I started seeing 5 years ago. We have been doing CBT therapy, but I don't know if this is effective for me anymore. I tend to intellectualize everything and I'm very self aware. So it can feel like I'm not getting a lot out of the sessions - I'm just talking and psychoanalyzing myself.","I have never taken any psychotropic medications.",No.,No.,"I do recreationally smoke/ingest marijuana and have used it to self medicate. I don't believe I have an issue with it as I don't use it everyday, and usually take at least a week off from it at least once a month. I have not experienced psychosis.",No.,"There is a history of ADHD in my family, but I don't think anyone has been formally tested. My mom has said herself, my dad, and my brother all likely have it. My maternal side definitely has a history of neurodivergence, but again, I don't know of any formal diagnoses on that side. I have two cousins on my paternal side that are on the autism spectrum. I remember as a kid I would occasionally flap my hands, and these cousins saw me doing that and started doing it as well. I remember my aunts and uncles at the time being annoyed. I don't remember exact details, but I do remember feeling like I did something wrong, and stopped stimming with my hands in front of people.",N/A.,"I believe I did.","Not currently. My main hobby is reading, and I spend a lot of time with my friends and family.",No.,"I currently live with my boyfriend and our two friends who are also a couple.","My sister and her husband were displaced by an apartment fire and had to move in with my parents last December. They had their first baby in January, and since I live in the same town as my parents, I've been able to visit them weekly.","I grew up very religious (Evangelical Christian), and my whole family is heavily involved in their church community. I was heavily involved for my whole life as well until I left this church 5 years ago. It was (and at times still is) a challenging transition, but overall I have maintained strong relationships with my family members.","I'm very empathetic, and can look at things from a bunch of different perspectives. I'm loyal to the people I love. I'm a strong communicator.","I don't think I struggle in these areas. Growing up in the church community, I learned a lot of social skills and was able to make and maintain friendships.","I've been dating my current boyfriend for the past 3 years, and we have lived together since last September. I notice that my religious trauma can come up when it comes to division of labor, and in our sex life. I have always felt safe to communicate to my boyfriend when these triggers come up.","A lot for sure, usually I will have a youtube podcast on during the day while I work. Tiktok and Instagram I also use daily. I have decided to take a break from social media for the entire month of August because current events are too much to handle right now.","No, I have never been tested.",N/A,"I went to college and got my bachelor's degree. I always did well in school, usually A's and B's.","I've always had issues with certain textures. There are certain foods I don't like to eat both as a kid and now due to their texture. As a kid I had issues with seams in my socks and tags. I still have some issues with clothing texture, but it is less frequent.

We have lived without hot water and heat, and money due to the domestic violence, as well as verbal abuse. I also want to note that Lily recently (May 2024 I believe) stated she was sexually assaulted after she was invited by a male friend (boyfriend?) to go fishing with his father. This was investigated by the DA office but they did not want to pursue charges because Lily’s story was very mixed up when explaining what happened.","Poor social skills due to annoying others on purpose, talking over others, trying to control situations/activities, asking for/taking things from others, not being kind. Always argumentative with both adults and other children and isn’t aware of it. She has trouble when she is told no and will beg until she gets what she wants or may cry, scream and have a tantrum, and at times hurt herself.",None,"Picky eater",None,"Lily tried a stimulant medication for ADHD when she was about 7 years old which cause her tics to get worse. She was on it a short time and taken off because she was crying of neck pains due to the tics. She only ever tried a stimulant again in 2024, and her tics became more severe and she had overly emotional behaviors and had been taken off again. She has been in therapy off and on since 5 years old. I haven’t found anything that has helped yet and she doesn’t think therapy helps. She does like going to church events and socializing with others. However, she has trouble socializing appropriately at times.","Lily has seen therapists off and on since she was five years old. She has also been involved in in-home therapy and at one point had a therapeutic mentor. She is not currently seeing anyone, however, she is on a few waitlists for outpatient and in-home therapy again.","Lily was only ever prescribed Focalin XR for ADHD when she was around seven years old. She was then prescribed Concerta at 12 years old, this year recently in 2024. Both of these caused more severe tics than what she already suffers with. She seemed more emotional on the Concerta, I didn’t really see any improvement and wasn’t comfortable with her on them.",No,"Within the past month of July 2024, Lily has been having suicidal ideation and has self harmed herself, although not severely. For many years and still now she will hit/punch herself in the forehead when frustrated repeatedly and recently started scratching herself. In regards to the self harm, she has been using sharp objects to scratch her arms.",Never,"ADHD and ODD. She was also diagnosed with a genetic disorder called Incontinentia Pigmenti when she was 2 weeks old. She had surgery in January 2024 to remove her gallbladder. She has an enlarged right kidney, and fatty liver disease.","I know there are mental health concerns on her paternal side, but I don’t know what they are specifically. As her mother I suffer with anxiety and panic attacks since childhood, as well as OCD, possibly other things. I was diagnosed with depression as well before but I am not sure that I currently have depression.","I suffered from pre-eclampsia when I was pregnant with Lily and was induced 2 weeks early.","Lily walked and talked on time, potty trained by 3-3.5 years old. However, she was in early intervention but I don’t know the exact terms or reasoning why. I only remember there being sensory issues.",None,None,"Lily lives with me (mom) and a 3 year old brother and 1 year old sister. We lived with her grandfather (my father) for almost a year in a very small space before transitioning into a shelter where we are now (since May). It is a scattered site shelter where we are in our own apartment with 2 bedrooms.","We moved in May into the shelter, away from Lily’s school where she had to be transported over an hour each morning to finish the year. During the summer we also commute to the same town to bring her little brother to therapy services Mon-Fri.","Lily has always lived with me (mom). However, we did move a lot. I had more children and became a single mom of three and we struggled with domestic violence. We struggled with verbal and financial abuse, and didn’t have basic necessities like heat and hot water. Lily’s dad has been out of her life most of her life which has taken a toll on her. He has been in and out but more out. He is starting to come around but it is bringing up a lot of emotions for her and she’s struggling with it. We lived with her grandfather (my father) for a year and he has a problem with alcohol. She had to witness him drunk more often than not and he often got angry and scary as a result. Hence why we are now in a shelter because it became problematic.","When asked this question Lily said she is good at basketball, she’s funny, and she’s smart. In my opinion (mom) I think she is good at building things and knows technology well. She is pretty good at cooking and a good caregiver to her siblings most of the time.","Lily has trouble making friends and she agrees with this. She also has trouble keeping friendships although this has improved this past year somewhat. It has been reported by the school and also Lily that there has been constant drama in these relationships and the friendships are often on and off.","Lily states she notices people often play with her feelings and don’t actually like her and agree to date her because friends told them too. Throughout the year she has said she has been in multiple different relationships with the same and opposite sex. I have had concerns in the past and possibly the present also of sexually charged conversations and behaviors. She seems to want to “date” anyone who seems to give her attention. She is always talking about dating and making comments about boys and grown men on the street.","Lily isn’t allowed to have social media, however, she continues to find ways to access it even without me knowing. It becomes problematic and she is always involved in some kind of drama with social media which is why I don’t allow it.",No,"Maria Weston Chapman Middle School, 7th grade","Lily is on an IEP due to her behavior issues due to her ADHD/ODD diagnosis.

I have had 20 sessions of ECT (6 in 2011 and 14 in 2017) which I believe may have been the root cause of my decline in cognitive functioning.  My other concerns are in regards to my  mental health.  I am diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder with borderline personality features.  Not sure what all that means but I want more in deepth knowledge as to this diagnosis.","I have PTSD caused from sexual assault in 2014 which causes pseudoseizures or periods of starring.  I am not really aware of these sessions, I have only been told about them from other people.  I underwent an EMU (epilepsy monitoring unit) at MGH in which they ruled them not actual seizures.  I was also sexually assaulted in 2018 by my ex-husband (then he was my husband).  I currently have some very bad flashbacks when I watch certain shows on TV, hear triggering words or see someone that looks like the person who assaulted me in 2014.  Because of the nature of the assault in 2014 I have permanent neck damage, herniated discs in my neck.  I was on percocet 3 times per day and underwent many procedures to try and alleviate the pain.  I take Lyrica currently for the pain without percocet but I can only drive for a maximum of 30 minutes due to this pain and impairment.  This has created much distress in my daily living.","Due to Bipolar I Disorder, I have many mood swings including but not limited to severe depression (sometimes suicidal ideation but not lately); hypomania, mania, irritability, and severe anxiety.","Concussion when I was in the 8th grade which produced severe migraines which continue to this day.

I have good awareness of myself as a person. I know my wants and needs.","I don't have any difficulties initiating/maintaining friendships. I usually like to have a few really close friends instead of a large group. I didn't really make that many lasting friends in high school, but I don't think that will be the case in college.","I've only had one serious romantic relationship. In that relationship I think that the fact that I really value my independence and alone time was a problem. But it ended more to do with discovering my sexuality.","My hours on social media are usually around 2 hours. I spend the most time on Pinterest and Youtube. Others I use are Instagram and Tumblr.",N/A,"Chapman University","I'm starting my first year in college in Fall 2024. I want to get accommodations for ADHD mainly for whenever I have a test or quiz for a class like a separate, quiet environment and additional time to complete the test.

occupational or relational impairment","Beyond what I checked above, other things I would like testing to address are learning strategies for success in academics, social impairment, motivation, staying on track/motivation.","I do have history of trauma early neglect from parents, physical, mental, and emotional abuse. These days, this come up in the form of night terrors where I would hurt myself in my sleep and occasional triggerred flashbacks which lead to an overwhelming sense of negative emotion. I used to feel dissociated all day everyday, but I have gotten out of that ""trance"" since undergrad. I used to day dream often and would lay in bed all day just daydreaming - I still do this occasionally, but now I have a pet I am responsible for feeding and he helps me snap out of it.","Mood concerns I have are hallucinations when I am not on Effexor XR 75 mcg. I used to hear and see things frequently until I got on this antidepressant. I also have been told I have a lack of tone that people take as rude or offensive, a resting b face, and no empathy. I do not remember this until I am reminded by my boyfriend or siblings and they correct me.",No,"Picky eater","Ever since I was a child, I have not had a good relationship with sleep. As I grew older, I have a harder time falling asleep, I wake up frequently throughout the night, and feel restless when I do sleep. I used to sleep walk often and have night terrors, but being on effexor has helped that. I tried melatonin, meditation, and benadryl to help me sleep, but nothing works. I just need to lay there for a few hours, then I will eventually dose off.","What I have tried already is self help strategies I find online, therapy, OTC supplements (melatonin), exercise an hour before bed, meditation, yoga, and prescription medications. The only thing that seemed particularly effective was the prescription medication and therapy. The medication helped balance my norepinephrine and serotonin while the therapy helped me learn coping and better academic success strategies, however, I think I need more specific behavioral help as the therapy is too general and hasn't been successful as I am failing in school.","Yes. I worked with a counselor in undergrad for 3 years and a psychiatrist for 2 years.","I have tried or are currently taking psychotropic medications. I have been on Effexor XR 74 mcg for about a year now and will be trying Concerta 18 mg soon. I tried sertraline and another SSRI before but it was not beneficial. This SNRI has been the only thing that has helped me. There were no adverse side effects with SNRI, with SSRIs, I had frequent night sweats that was disruptive to my already poor quality of sleep.","No issues with psychosis. I used to see or hear things that aren't there before effexor xr. I think it may have been due to anxiety but I had them ever since I could remember, my siblings would tell me if they don't hear something or don't see something.",No,"No issues with recreational drug use now or in the past. No issues where I would say I used substances to self medicate. I tried melatonin and benadryl to help me sleep but they did not work, even with increases dosages.","Asthma - Wixela 2 puffs daily, Ventolin PRN
Allergies - Zyrtec 10 mg daily
Eczema - Triamcinolone topical cream and ointment
Anxiety/PTSD - Effexor XR 75 mcg
Mild Anemia - Iron Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg BID","My family does not believe in mental health, so no one has diagnoses. My father gets night terrors, and I believe my maternal uncle is autistic.","I have never been pregnant.","I met all developmental milestones. However, in school, I was always behind other kids. I had extra tutoring and special learning classes for reading, math, and speaking in grade school - however, I do not believe I was ever diagnosed with anything. I was just told I always needed extra help and extra practice.","I like to hang out with my friends, go raving, shopping, and play with my cats.",No,"I live in an apartment with my 2 younger siblings who are in undergrad. I also have 2 young cats.",No,"I moved alot as a young child until I was 9 years old. My mom was not loving and very hostile towards me, but loved my brother. My dad was at home but not ""present"". I would get physically, mentally, and abused by my mom and grandpa. I felt alone a lot as a kid; with other kids, there was always a disconnect that I couldn't figure out and I still feel that as an adult. I am not sure what it is but everyone always leaves me without telling me why. My parents did not seem involved in my life. They were always working and my grandpa would baby sit me but he was very mean. My parents seem to have their own mental health issues; my dad gets night terrors and I think my mom has bipolar disorder or something. There are no known diagnosis in your family of origin other than geriatric dementia and alzheimers. My maternal uncle is not diagnosed but I think he is autistic, my mom just describes him as mentally slow and my family is aware that he is not normal. On my the paternal side of my lineage, I do not know anything because my family does not talk to them or know much of them.","What I would say are my best strengths and qualities are that I am good at following orders/rules and am obedient and loyal.","I have difficulties initiating or maintaining friendships with others. As a child, I would talk a lot and was very extroverted, but I would get yelled at my authoritative figures and became fearful of getting hit if I got a complaint about my behavior. In my adolescent and adult life, I have found myself having issues with processing what people tell me, and especially in class lectures. I always need to rewatch the professor's lectures so I can pause and process what they said. I have always had a hard time making friends and did not have friends until college where I was able to go to counselling and learn socializing strategies and how to cope with my own anxiety. What goes on in my mind during a conversation is what to say next so I forget to listen to the other person and end up saying nothing at all. There is no volatility or ""drama"" in relationships, but most times people would ghost me and I would never find out why. I want relationships with people and make friends, but it is hard for me.","The only thing that feels relevant in terms of your dating, romantic relationship history is that my one and only boyfriend I have ever had is still with me to this day after nearly 6 years together. He has been my most successful relationship and we connected well from day 1. I do get feelings that I am hypersexual, which concerns me.","The amount of hours I would say I am using social media per day right now on Instagram and tik tok is about 3-4 hours. This is mainly during study breaks and before bed.",None,"Northeastern University School of Pharmacy, P3","In my grade school years, I often had teacher concerns that I am not keeping up with other students but we never learned why. I just went to extra practice before school and during the second half of school. These days, now that I am more able to analyze my study habits, I have trouble focusing in school during lecture and while studying. This gets in the way of my schools and decreases my quality of life because I live, breathe, and eat academics, however, still can't do well. I have always been a straight C's student. I am currently about to finish my 2nd year of my doctorate and start my 3rd year.","This was so long, I wish it was shorter or multiple choice.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5975733130324047649/5975733130324047649_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5975733130324047649/5975733130324047649_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5975733130324047649/5975733130324047649_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5975733130324047649/5975733130324047649_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5975733130324047649/5975733130324047649_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5975733130324047649/5975733130324047649_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5975733130324047649/5975733130324047649_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5975733130324047649/5975733130324047649_base64_75_1721764114.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5975733130324047649/5975733130324047649_base64_76_1721764114.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

Very minor sexual abuse when I was a child by a non-family member but nothing I feel has impacted me. Emotionally abusive relationships. And dismissive communication with my father of mental health in general. I do have nightmares sometimes and I can get triggered randomly and become emotional.","I do struggle to do anything but lay in bed outside of work, I isolate a lot and tend to avoid making plans. I get overstimulated and overwhelmed easily. I can be very irritable and sometimes very emotional and sensitive. I am worry a lot, hold myself to too high of standards and stress over things out of my control.","No head injuries.","Picky eater
Binge eating
Emotional over eating","I go through spurts of bad sleep. I generally don’t sleep great. I wake up multiple times a night. I can usually fall asleep initially no problem. I use a white noise machine as without it my brain runs a million miles a minute. I also need to be cool with a fan or AC. I used to take sleep meds but I have severe sleep apnea so I’ve had to move away from those.","I have been in therapy for years and still currently am, I see my psychiatrist once every month and a half for 3 years now. Nothing seems to be super effective. I become so overwhelmed by my feelings that I feel exhausted 24/7. My current antidepressants almost make me feel dissociated.","Yes off and on for several years. My current therapist I’ve been seeing weekly for over a year now.","I currently take Trintellix 10mg. I have taken several medications and I couldn’t tell you all of them but I know I had a bad reaction to Prozac which made me feel suicidal.","I don’t believe this is an issue for me. I’ve had a couple panic attacks but that’s it.","My mind has gone to ideation at times but never enough to act on it or attempt. Just becomes exhausting always feeling sad and unmotivated.","Never drugs or alcohol. Most I’ve taken is CBD gummies to relax.","High BP: Hydrochlorothiazide
Major Depression & Anxiety: Trintellix
Severe Sleep Apnea: CPAP for 10+ yrs","Yes primarily on my mom’s side: depression, anxiety, bipolar, adhd, suicide, ocd etc.

My dad’s side to my knowledge is anxiety and depression.",N/A,"To my knowledge, yes.","No. I work two jobs. I used to have hobbies but since moving, all of my stuff is packed in boxes.","Physical therapy for when I broke my ankle a 4-5 yrs ago.","I currently live in a duplex with my boyfriend’s former stepdad and my stepdaughter and my boyfriend’s sister lives next door with her two kids. We have a dog and two cats of our own.","I lost my brother to suicide back in 2006, my mom unexpectedly to cancer in 2021. I moved to Massachusetts after living in nh my whole life in 2021 which is away from all family and friends.","My parents divorced when I was 2. My dad remarried to a step mom I disliked and eventually divorced. My mom was with a boyfriend for 20+ years that she wasn’t fully happy with but I consider him a second dad to this day. Both of my parents were very involved in my life and always came to any shows or sports games I was in. My mom was more the physical and emotional support and my dad more the financial but despite divorce they always remained cordial around me and coparented well. My mom struggled very much with her depression. I had anger issues as a preteen/teen. On my mom’s side, there are known diagnoses of bipolar, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety and a few people have attempted suicide and my brother was successful in his attempt while high on drugs. Alcoholism runs on my mom’s side as well. My dad’s side I believe is just depression and anxiety in some aunts and uncles.","My drive, I’m caring, loving and kind to those I care about. I keep going despite obstacles.","Yes. I can be very sensitive to things people say. My current relationship has had a lot of issues lately especially with communication. I do have some long term friends I’d give the shirt off of my back for and we connect via phone as they are now hours away from me after moving.","I don’t think I’ve ever had a fully healthy relationship and in my mind I know when I should walk away but for some reason stay until I’m broken. My first major relationship was good at first then became very emotionally abusive. I dated between but now in my longest relationship I’ve ever had we were great at first and then my mom died at our year mark which broke me and we’ve kind of been struggling progressively since. We are now awful at communicating, quick to anger and annoyance and it’s felt toxic. Sexual intimacy has been gone for over a year and emotional regulation is difficult and we have both gone through phases of codependency.","I use Facebook, Instagram and TikTok and I do spend at least 3 hrs per night after work.","No neuropsych eval ever done.",N/A,"I have my Master’s degree and I actually teach college courses online part time. While I was a student however it just always took me a bit longer to retain information so my study time was a bit longer. I cannot grasp math at all.","I would just like peace of mind to at least even rule out things so I can work to see improvements with the right medication and steps forward.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5972085266329867599/5972085266329867599_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5972085266329867599/5972085266329867599_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5972085266329867599/5972085266329867599_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5972085266329867599/5972085266329867599_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5972085266329867599/5972085266329867599_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5972085266329867599/5972085266329867599_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5972085266329867599/5972085266329867599_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5972085266329867599/5972085266329867599_base64_75_1721399327.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5972085266329867599/5972085266329867599_base64_76_1721399328.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

I am also open to anything additional my referring clinician may suggest, as well as the clinician conducting my initial evaluation.","Yes.  Diagnosed with PTSD (childhood, verbal and physical abuse, narcissistic father, neglect, etc.).
No nightmares.  Comes up more as anxiety.","Fatigue.  Can't get out of bed.  Occasional mood swings.  Poor social skills.  Irritability.  Emotional (cry easily).  Difficulty focusing.  Anxious at times (cutting people off, mind racing, etc.).  Emotional eating.","Punched in the head once.  No diagnosed concussion.
I lost consciousness only once in my life and I had a really bad flu at the time and attribute it to that.","Emotional over eating","I used to take Benadryl nightly to stay asleep but my clinician advised me to stop and I have.  I tend to fall asleep easily (unless extremely anxious).  My challenge is usually staying asleep.  Through work with a clinician I have been making more of an effort to improve my sleeping (cutting down on caffeine, winding down before bed, chilled room, etc.) which has helped.  I also take a magnesium supplement at bedtime.","I've cut down on caffeine, relaxation exercises, magnesium at bedtime.  I sometimes read a book before bed to wind-down as well.","Yes.  I have been seeing a therapist since earlier this year.  Unfortunately I have worked through a few of them (departed when I felt we weren't a match) and have finally found a therapist I feel aligned with and continue to meet with her weekly.","Lexapro 20mg - been taking for years, way before I was seeing my current therapist.
In the past I tried more meds than I can remember before settling on Lexapro (Prozac, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, and others I can't recall).  Also was prescribed lorazepam once when younger but did not fair well with it.","thankfully no","thankfully no","What could be considered self-medicating would be the use of benedryl to help me stay asleep.  I've since stopped that.  I also tried weed to help me sleep but only for a month and have stopped that as well.  
I'm not a recreational drug user, nor have I ever been.  I'm a social drinker.  I do love coffee but as mentioned I am now doing more with decaf than caf.","Depression (persistent) - Lexapro
Anxiety - Lexapro
PTSD - no meds specific to that, therapy","Parents are both immigrants.  Their culture isn't open to accepting 'mental health' illnesses so obtaining family history is a challenge.  I can tell you that my mother suffers from severe anxiety and likely depression.  Her grandmother, my great grandmother died by suicide (hung herself).  I would speculate depression and perhaps anxiety are also prevalent on my fathers side but again folks don't talk about this unfortunately.","NA - never pregnant","I believe so.","Avid Bruins/hockey fan.  Love to garden in the summer.  Travel.","I have not","I live alone.","My dog died suddenly in April 2023.
I had to change schools halfway through high school which sucked.","Parents are immigrants.  Growing up was very much being caught between 2 cultures... one at home and one outside of home.  
Mother worked a lot and worked nights.  Grandmother and aunt around to help raise me.  I was given lots of responsibilities at a very young age.  It was very much 'speak when spoken to' and 'do as you are told.'  Parents were VERY strict, especially my father.  Parents really didn't seem to care about me and my development as a person, just expected me to do well in school, help around the house and do as I was told.
Mother with anxiety and depression, great grandmother (maternal side) committed suicide.  Cousin on maternal side has bipolar disorder and other on maternal side with severe anxiety.  Alcohol on both sides of family but more maternal side.","I'm loyal, determined, curious, caring, hard working and funny.  I'm a positive individual even though my background was rough.  I'm very grateful for the life I live but do hope to get help with focus and anxiety.","I do lack desire to initiate friendships and relationships.  But I think mostly because I accept people for who they are and prefer to connect with people with similar core values to me.  I'm ok with a small group of close friends and prefer that to a large group of acquaintances.  I'm very much a quality over quantity type of person and don't mind alone time.","I'm 47 and have never had a serious long-term relationship lasting over a year.  Trust is important for me.  I'm very independent, likely because my childhood was with strict parents with many restrictions.  Intimacy can be hard sometimes as well.","facebook - occassional scrolling
linkedin - few times a week for <5min to stay connected
nothing else as social media is a big waste of time","No.  I once conducted this type of evaluation through college services when in college (over 20 years ago) and the results came back inconclusive (they weren't sure if my grandmothers death were making my anxiety worse and therefore impacting my ability to focus/study).  No testing since.",NA,"I have a BA in Biology and a PMP certification (Project Management).
I'd like to go back for my MBA but the thought of school terrifies me because I'm reminded of how much I struggled in college.  My concerns are inability to focus and retain information.","I'm open to have a discussion if you wish to elaborate on anything I mentioned.

forgetting multi step instructions","When I was very young (around ten), I received full psychological testing and was diagnosed with Autism and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. However, after many years of trying various anxiety medications to no avail and my condition seemingly getting worse, I recently decided to undergo another round of psychological testing. The psychiatrist said he believes I have Bipolar II disorder and prescribed me a medication called Lamictal. He ordered neurotransmitter testing and genetic testing to confirm his hunch, though I do not believe these methods are FDA approved. As of today, we are still awaiting the results. In addition to these alternative methods, I would also like to have more traditional psychological testing done to see if they come to the same conclusion and to verify if the psychological testing I received when I was ten was correct.","I do not, at least nothing severe enough worth noting","Some of these mood issues have manifested in various ways throughout my life. I recall often struggling to get out of bed and isolating myself. According to my parents, mood swings were a significant issue when I was younger. In the last four or five years, I have appeared to be externally level-headed without showing these mood swings outwardly. However, people around me often comment on differences in the decisions I make, which I believe could be a result of these mood swings.

I have tried to identify any patterns in my mood because I notice there are periods when I feel quite good and other times when I do not. Despite my efforts, I have not been able to find any consistent patterns in my mood variability.

Due to my autism, my social skills have always been relatively poor, but in recent years, they have improved significantly to the point where I can fit in normally in all social settings. However, there are times when I am much more social than others, again with no noticeable patterns. Excessive worry is something I have consistently dealt with throughout my life.","I have not, however I have received an MRI once or twice in my life with nothing noteworthy to report.",,"My sleep patterns are often inconsistent; sometimes I can fall asleep easily, while other times I struggle. When I have difficulty falling asleep, I often take melatonin to help. Regardless of how well I sleep, I frequently have a hard time getting out of bed and experience extreme fatigue throughout the day. This issue has worsened in the past few months.","I have read many self-help books, which have significantly helped me with my social issues and other challenges related to autism. Currently, I take several over-the-counter supplements (ashwagandha, green tea, multivitamin, B-complex, Alpha GPC, zinc, and magnesium), although I haven't noticed any significant changes from these supplements. When I meditated consistently, I felt it helped with my anxiety, but only marginally. In the past two years, I have exercised regularly and started eating healthier, which has led to significant weight loss but has not affected the way I feel.","I have worked with therapists sporadically throughout my life, but I have not seen one since I left for college about a year ago.","In the past, I have taken Lexapro, Prozac, and Wellbutrin. While my parents insist I also took Zoloft, I do not remember ever taking it. Currently, I take Adderall, Effexor, and Gabapentin as needed for sleep or anxiety. I haven't noticed any benefits from the medications I took in the past, although they definitely caused extreme weight gain, and my parents say they also led to significant behavior issues. Effexor provides a small, barely noticeable benefit. Among all the medications I have taken, Adderall has had the most beneficial effect, significantly improving my mood and focus. However, I am concerned about taking this medication indefinitely due to its potential for causing dependency. Gabapentin has been effective for severe anxiety, but it makes me feel cloudy when I take it.",,no,,"I have not.","I believe both of my parents suffer from anxiety and take medication for it. In terms of my siblings or other family members I do not know.",No.,"Not to my knowledge.","Yes, I am the treasurer of my fraternity at IU and am also involved in a business fraternity. In my free time, I enjoy golfing and keeping up with current events (national, global, and financial). I also enjoy watching movies and TV shows and playing video games occasionally.","I have not.","My parents are divorced, me and my three siblings spend half of the week at my Moms house and half of the week at my Dads house.  My Mom lives alone and my Dad is married and has a child with his second wife.  When I am away at school I share an apartment with three other members of my fraternity.","Nothing recently that I believe would have a major impact on my life. My grandfather passed away about two years ago which was difficult because we were close, but I think I have managed fine.","My DNA test results show that I am 100% Ashkenazi Jewish.  My family immigrated to the United States during WWII and has lived here ever since.","I find it difficult to notice traits about myself, so I usually rely on what others say about me. People often tell me that I am very unique and quite different from anyone they have met before, for better or worse. I like to think that I am intelligent and have a unique way of thinking and solving problems. I have always been ambitious and had a clear direction throughout my life. People also say they admire my confidence, charisma, and how comfortable I am in my own skin, which is interesting because I do not feel that way about myself. Also, I feel I have a good sense of style (though some might disagree)","I have also been able to initiate and maintain friendships throughout my life. Romantic relationships have always been more difficult but this has gotten easier in recent years.",,"I spend a lot of time on social media, way more than I should.  I mainly use Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and X, I probably spend on average six hours a day on social media.","I have not; the psychological test I recently received did not include any assessments besides the genetic and neurotransmitter testing.","Incoming sophomore at Indiana University","I do not have any, I have always excelled at school.","One last thing I would like to mention, which I did not have the chance to address earlier, is that throughout my entire life, I have felt as though I view the world through a piece of glass, as if I am separated from everything happening around me. This is the only way I can describe it. It might be something similar to derealization, or perhaps it is a symptom of autism.

I often avoid situations or people who i feel like might neglect me. i avoid most social situations as much as possible.

I was also told i am ""too direct"" and borderline unprofessional.","When i feel the most overwhelmed or confused i self-isolate. I have an incredibly strong support system who have shown nothing but love. However, my brain still thinks that i will become a burden so i tend to hide when i'm feeling down or emotionally unstable. I don't have good social skills. I interpret things as literal and miss most social cues.

Emotional over eating","i have tried all kinds of sleeping ais and exercises to fall asleep. Most of them are not very effective. I had previously been taking a general OTC sleeping aid from Costco that helped me get a routine down for 1 year and a half. it helped my body to become tired at a certain point. However, that was ruined when i strayed away from the routine and started experiencing more stress from my personal life and home.","Therapy helped with starting my mental health journey and establishing better coping strategies. It also helped with being more proactive with my physical health and being more kind to my struggles. Exercise helps but it's incredibly difficult to stay motivated. Especially when i started emotional eating.","i had last worked with a therapist around 3 years ago. This was due to a change in employment and feeling like i wasn't keeping up. I had stayed in sessions for about 3months (8sessions). i was making strides within my job and stopped seeing her due to a schedule change. I also didn't have a diagnosis for ADHD at that time. We thought i had intermittent anxiety. But i knew it was much more severe than that. On the outside i can appear to be very well put together. Internally i am in a lot of physical pain and feeling lost most of the time. I had learned over the years that i was trying to say the ""right"" things to impress my therapist which was not beneficial to myself.","I am taking Escitalopram 10 mg for my anxiety. it had gotten rid of my constant overthinking and general stress about everything. The overthinking and stress is not completely gone but it usually doesn't consume my life until there are too many emotional/social stressors. It had also gotten rid of my daily suicidal ideation and put my depression diagnosis in remission for the last 3 years. i no longer have any adverse side effects from this medication. 

I am taking Vyvanse 20mg & Dextroamphetmine 5mg for my ADHD symptoms. Once the anxiety symptoms were removed i noticed i was having so much added difficulty in my life. Especially in my employment. i have trouble focusing, task switching, sitting in one place or still, some days i couldn't think at all. the medications have helped but are not perfect. Maybe 10 days out of the month i still i feel like the medications does not work (during my period). I am working with my psychiatrist to have an increased dose during that time. the side effects were mild to moderate the first 4 weeks i started the medications. i would feel drowsy and sleepy some days, increased dehydration, not wanting to eat, nausea, headaches.

I am in constant worry about my parent's health & finances and it bring me a lot of distress every time they experience a change or loss. They have always relied heavily on their children to pick up where they lack in parenting. We have had to raise each other, complete applications on behalf of our parents (for school enrollment as kids), i complete applications for employment and resources for my parents). my father needs constant reminders and structure. i remember having to help him since i was at least 17years old. i can remember my parents and family being close before the age of 10 years old. After that age is when there were ongoing family struggles of neglect and my mom's untreated schizophrenia had began to affect her quality of life and parenting.","i was not allowed to learn about my family history. My mother was very paranoid and forbade us from knowing our family. She kept a lot of her life a secret and didn't like my father's family as many of them had a history of gang violence or substance use issues.","Pattern recognition and having empathy. Pattern recognition has helped me survive in general. It has helped in social situations where i needed to learn social norms and how i should ""act"" in different situations. If i don't understand i social situation i have to google to find responses to better help me understand. Sometimes i feel comfortable to ask the person what they mean and other times i feel like it could seem inappropriate to that specific person. As in they think i'm asking to many questions that should be naturally understood. it helps me get through my job as much of the casework are repetitive. i can troubleshoot skills with ease. Much better than my peers and have been able to share my knowledge when we had a huge system change in the database we use. i also have good cognitive and emotional empathy. I have the ability to understand all the different that can play into someone experiencing a loss or going through a challenging situation. I tend to physical feel the sadness the person is feeling and is articulating to me. This has help strengthen my personal relationships.

i also experience manic episodes which makes me think it's bipolar, those last for upwards of 7 days. thankfully i have wonderful impulse control so honestly it just helps me feel really productive. i calculated that i seem to have a psychotic episode every 18 months and im not sure what triggers it but i have theories. i seem to have manic episodes about twice a year and those seem to be linked to the extreme hyperfixation symptom of my autism.","i think i had a mild concussion as a kid when my brother hit me in the head really hard with a brush but it was really really mild",,"i sleep fine when im mentally well. i am in seroquel which helps me fall and stay asleep but i dont need it to fall asleep. during manic episodes i dont sleep at all even if i try, but i still try anyway.","i have been in therapy since 8th grade when i stabbed a kid with a pen for making sexual gestures at my friends, i got expelled and was in therapy ever since. i never found therapy to be effective because i felt that none of the therapists actually wanted to help me address the source of the issues. i ended up teaching myself some positive coping mechanisms and productive ways to talk about my problems so they can get fixed after having a particularly bad experience in therapy. i kind of dont want to try again, i just want a diagnosis and a continuation of my medication so i can continue my treatment with an updated plan.","ive worked with numerous therapists since 2016 and they havent been very helpful (except for one i worked with in high school who was very to-the-point and goal-oriented) im willing to put in the work to get better and i've been doing that outside of therapy as a traumatic experience with a really bad therapist put me off from it basically forever","lexapro - 7 years for depression, ineffective as it did not address the source of the problems
abilify - prescribed for acute psychotic and paranoid symptoms, worked but the agitation side effect made me want to actually kill people
quetiapine - currently on, working well and curbing my psychosis. though even at half-to+quarter-strength of the lowest doses it makes me so tired the next day it's hard to function",,"in the past i was suicidal before i escaped my abusive father and before i had HRT. i have attempted at least 3 times but i have been free from attempts and psychological self-harm for two years now i think",,"just autism in 8th grade but my providers never put it on my list of diagnoses. they also said i have major depressive which isnt true because it was just dysphoria and forming ptsd due to being actively abused","nothing at all which is insane. i know both my parents had been sexually abused/assaulted at some point in their lives but they refuse to acknowledge it or call it what it is but no bipolar or psychotic tendencies",,yes,"when i was in school i was in track and was involved in art stuff. as an adult outside of my work as a pharmacy technician i am a freelance artist, i draw digitally and traditionally. i also like making wearable art, like mascot costumes, masks, and cosplay outfits. i am heavily involved in the sacramento furry community since i was 8n high school which has been amazing for me in terms of being able to make friends with other queer people and artists. i feel like i have a wonderful community surrounding me at the moment","i worked with a speech therapist in high school but she was more of a regular therapist that helped me find ways to talk about the things that were troubling me because i had trouble vocalizing them in a professional setting","i currently live with my partner (Alys, 23, she/they) who is the love of my life. we support each other emotionally and i am so much more happy living with her than i ever was with my parents","not recently? my parents divorced in 2016 which caused my father's abusive behavior to increase 10x and my.mother's neglect and avoidance behaviors to increase as well. i have a history of not being able to hold jobs for more than 2 years due to my recurrant psychosis and i would like to get a handle on it. in october 2023 i finally was able to move out of my mother's house and into an apartment with my partner and it was the best decision i ever made","im not sure what you mean but aight
my father had two brothers and all three of them were autistic (undiagnosed but you know you can just tell by being around them) his father died at age 13 and he would always bring it up when he made us upset on purpose as if we were lucky to have him. when i got upset he would threaten to have me taken away. when i was in elementary school he told me CPS was going to take me away, then when i got sent to inpatient for the first time he would have me threatened to be sent there instead.
my mother came from a poor family and grew up poor, her father was an alcoholic and passed well before i was born and her mother is emotionally tough as nails.my mother went back to school after my brother and i were born and became a pharmacist but that came at the expense of her missing our childhood. now she doesnt know how to connect with my brother and i and just kinds of avoids us. she was also a victim of emotional abuse at the hands of my father
my brother (he just turned 21 bless him) is a workaholic just like our mother, he suffered worse than i did during the dark times. our father kind of made us hate each other so he could have control over us which sucks because we used to be super close. i hardly ever see him anymore but he's kind of a pessimist but he's trying to be better and im proud of him","i like to think i'm optimistic, i always believe there is another way to do things, and i believe everyone can win. i believe anyone can be better if they genuinely want to be and im willing to support my friends and found family to my last breath. even if i get discouraged and whiny and panicky i calm down a pick myself back up again and try again.","im kind of an extrovert though my psychotic behaviors have scared me off as of late from making new friends. i dont feel like i cause drama and i certainly dont do it on purpose. i do have people who hate/stalk me because they took advantage of my kindness and i walked away when i realized they didnt want to be better people but i dont think i have too much of a hard time with friends. getting out of the house has got me meeting new people again which has been wonderful",,"too many 💀💀💀 im a twitter fiend. when i was having an episode last time i deleted the app cause i kept being passive aggressive to another one of my friends who was having a hard time  but i still have access to one of my accounts via internet. i feel like ive been better about it and am spending a lot less time online.","prior tested for autism in 8th and 10th grade but no more testing recently for anything else",,"when i was in high school i had an IEP for my autism but i dont remember much about what my accomodations were.
i graduated high school in 2019 and i graduated a pharmacy tech program in 2020","my pronouns are it/its/they but you didnt have an option for that 💀💀💀 i was told to look into you guys because i really need to know whats wrong with me in order to get the help i really need and get my psychosis under control before it controls me.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5957646641213569639/5957646641213569639_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5957646641213569639/5957646641213569639_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5957646641213569639/5957646641213569639_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5957646641213569639/5957646641213569639_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5957646641213569639/5957646641213569639_signature_59.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5957646641213569639/5957646641213569639_signature_82.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5957646641213569639/5957646641213569639_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5957646641213569639/5957646641213569639_base64_75_1719955466.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5957646641213569639/5957646641213569639_base64_76_1719955466.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate below:

occupational or relational impairment
""Mental Noise""","Unsure how much of this is based on pure behavioral/habitual changes. I feel like a lot of my issues may stem from a chemical space. I was much more organized and motivated up until post-schooling, and since then have had issues with where to focus my energy and attention, being able to properly identify the scope of tasks and my ambitions, and some amount of time-blindness.","Diagnosed with C-PTSD, including several years of mixed social and home abuse, mostly on the verbal and emotional fronts. I've only had one severe moment of physical abuse perpetrated on me. In the years since, I acknowledge that many of my actions are dictated by my fear of causing undue violent confrontation (on all fronts verbal/emotional/physical). This also includes my verbalizing very acutely my meanings and intentions, which leaves me being more verbose than some would prefer.","When I had not been medicated, there were definitely periods in my adult life where I would linger in bed and occasionally poke their head back in. I'm loathe to admit it, but there are definitely some hints of paranoia, grandiosity, irritability. I would say mood swings, but I feel like the times that I move between moods are not at breakneck speeds.
Note: I have asked others in the past to see if I have been somewhere on the bipolar spectrum, namely if I had cyclothymia. Tests have determined I likely am not.","No head injuries on that level to my knowledge.","Binge eating
Emotional over eating","I fall asleep easy, but prefer to wait until I feel sleepy to head to bed, so as to avoid lingering awake in the bed. Prefer door open and people around (i.e. spouse), and do experience some regressive behaviors if left to sleep alone in an area.
Staying asleep is fine.","I've sought therapy, have books on hand, practice 7-11 breathing, intermittently practice meditation, but these have all been to manage the C-PTSD/anxiety and depression. They have not been great for my primary concern: undiagnosed ADHD on a chemical level.","I've worked with two therapists in my recent adult life. My first was mostly interested in talk therapy, but rather than aid me in seeking answers or actions that I could take it mostly boiled down to spending 50 minutes of him having me talk about things. Just as we would feel like we were building up to something, the session would end and I'd be built up with nothing to really show for it.
The second therapist was great, we worked together for a year not only talking but guiding me to literature like ""The Body Keeps The Score"" and asking me to try certain exercises or interacting with people that I may have been reluctant to on a different scale. I had to stop only because he was preparing to retire and stepping away from health insurances, meaning all sessions would be fully out-of-pocket. I decided that we'd worked on everything I'd needed up to that point, so we parted ways.
Again though, I must stress that these therapists had no knowledge directly in ADHD, nor did they perceive that in me themselves, agreeing with testing that my concerns of these things were related to the C-PTSD.","I'm currently taking 200mg of Sertraline, tapered down from 100mg to 75 mg of Bupropion, and recently 1mg of Guanfacine before bed to act as a stop-gap while seeking assistance over these ADHD-associated symptoms.

I tapered down on the Bupropion due to feeling sluggish, slow of mind, and closer to a ""numb"" feeling. The Sertraline has been fine at 200, but I'm of the mind that I'd like to eventually taper down on that as well in time, if agreed upon with my current psych. The Guanfacine's blood-pressure drop seems to combat against some of my proclivities for feeling a surge of energy within my body that does NOT manifest in the ways previously described in this form.",,"There were some moments in my life of suicidal ideation, though they were brought on by moments of anxiety and stress. I would acknowledge that this was likely due to my diagnosed C-PTSD and depression.",,"Other than the aforementioned, I take a multivitamin and Vitamin D supplement as I'm not much for outdoor activities, and an OTC allergy med for pollen.","Mother had gone in for several mental health issues, though I was estranged from her since my early adult life through to her death about a year ago. Without certainty, she had some level of bipolar (several periods of mania and whiplash mood swings), a form of psychosis, depression, several suicide attempts, but nothing I personally have documented on paper. If it runs on my maternal side, they don't acknowledge it.
Father I've been estranged from since 15, and I do not know that he has ever been seen for mental health issues. My paternal grandmother did recently suffer from some suicidal ideation after her husband passed, but sought council and medical assistance. I believe she was diagnosed with a form of depression.","While I don't KNOW for certain, Mother was prone to drinking and smoking, so likely.",Yes.,"I do have communal hobbies, and do my best to partake when not working.

I stayed with her to look after those siblings, and my sister left for my Father's family (three extra siblings and DomWife) to escape the chaos.","I think I can carry conversations well, have strong convictions in my Social/Economic/Political beliefs, and attempt to stand against injustice I find in the world around me. I do my best to be kind, empathize with people, and attempt to look from outside of my own preconceived notions to ensure I'm not part of an echo chamber or digging my heels in against new ideas. I enjoy my ability to find patterns, exalt causes and ideas I believe in, and help people toward becoming their best selves.","I like to make connections, likely due to a trauma I can elaborate on during an intake call. I try to find commonalities, intentionally listen to others interests, and make sure people feel seen.
However, I'm not above also calling out these same individuals if they are demonstrably acting in bad faith and perpetuating negative acts and ideas.",,"I used to be terminally online (especially during the pandemic), but have since stepped back substantially.

occupational or relational impairment","I’ve just had a tough time with staying motivated. It’s something I’ve dealt with a long time. I don’t finish tasks, I procrastinate almost everything til the last minute. It’s made life incredibly difficult because the things I have to do in life I don’t do because of pressure and sometimes anxiety. And the more I wait to do them it only makes it worse.","Nothing I can pin point but I do have some trauma from past friendships that has me ghosting a lot of people in my life. Because I don’t want to get hurt. There is something when I was young that happened too and it did come back a few years ago and it’s been on my mind ever since.","It’s hard to get out of bed some days. I self isolate a lot too and get anxious when a people reach out to me. The worrying happens a lot more frequently now too.","Over 14 years or more I rode horses a lot and did have a concussion after a horse jumped a jump. I fell and completely blacked out. Next thing I know I’m on the sand opening my eyes and see an ambulance. A week or more prior to the incident I had hit my head riding a horse bareback and with no helmet. The doctor I saw, because I felt nauseous afterwards, said to don’t ride for a few weeks. But I had a team practice and rode my horse jumping and that day I had the concussion I had a helmet on. But I haven’t had anything since.","Bulimia

I definitely used to be more active and I’ve really let myself go in all aspects. I have tried some supplements and therapy I did in 2018 really helped when I was going through something.","I worked with a therapist in 2018 for over 4 months and it did work. I was dealing with a lot but I stopped seeing them and haven’t had anything until recently again.","I haven’t had any drugs",,"Yes. Most recently after losing my cat life seems even harder.

It is something I’m passionate about. I care about others too. Sometimes too much.","I’ve been with the same person for over 10 years. I’m not happy. I haven’t been happy for a while. But it’s comfortable and this person has a hard time with letting me go. They make it really difficult and I recently lost my cat of almost 16 years and I feel like I’m going through a lot right now with that.",,"I know I spend way too much time on my phone. But it’s an escape for me. I’d rather not deal with life and hide",No,,"Finished high school, almost didnt cause of my mental health, I wasn’t showing up my last year a lot. I missed a lot. But I made it through. I never finished community college, took some classes and then went to CA and wanted to follow my dreams in being an actress. It’s still something I really would like to do. I just don’t feel like myself right now","I can’t think of anything at the moment. I just know right now is one of the hardest times of my life. I’m usually hiding and not dealing with my problems.

occupational or relational impairment","I've had issues staying focused or on topic. I struggle to remember names and sequences. I will spiral on thoughts or topics, either leading to a minor existential crisis or a complete rabbit hole of research that lasts hours, but in some cases can distract me for months or years from something more consistent with my job or life (hobbies essentially).

I've had issues with eye-contact during social situations in recent years. Before that it was something I did to help focus, but now it seems for different reasons.

I often have a hard time with recall. For instance, I know this is an incomplete list, but I can't get my brain to remember the others.","Yes. Most of it stems from childhood, around 7-9 grade, though earlier experiences exist. One or two moments throughout college. Divorce. Living with a physically and emotionally abusive partner for a while. Religion caused lots of issues for me growing up and through my young adult life.

Abandonment is a common theme.","I've recently learned about the term ""sit pit"" in which one just gets stuck in a mode of looking at the phone or watching TV and needs motivation to get back to work. I don't have tantrums, but I can get into moods where I'm particularly frustrated by a person or group and have a hard time letting it go. 

I've noticed I cry again after years of not doing that. It seems healing, but I can't tell if that is okay or just unresolved trauma. it's usually when I see successful romance, someone being a good friend, or when I relate to someone's trauma.",no,,"sometimes I will spin on a topic and can't go to sleep. Mostly I notice I only get about 6 hours of sleep a night. So I will take a nap if I can. 7 hours is very effective for me. 8 makes me feel groggy.","Podcasts on ADHD and youtube videos (this form of content is much easier for me to consume). Therapy has been helpful over the past 10 years or so. 

I try to exercise daily and that DOES help. I had some confidence issues with Yoga, purely because I didn't know the poses and didn't like the feeling of being outpaced or not knowing what was going on, not because I reserve judgment about yoga itself. 

I have found noise-canceling headphones work (especially with certain types of music), stretching, walks, visual aids, close friendships, supportive environments, reminders (though organizing is very difficult for me),","5-6 Therapists of 10+ years. Usually changing because of job/insurance. Good experience overall.","I have not tried any. I have been recommended Vyvanse because of its slow release and single dosage, which I can assume would work better with my memory. My initial fear of medications like Adderall and Ritalin comes from friends who were either addicted or had severe reactions which gives me a little apprehension.",,"At one point, yes, but I immediately jumped back into therapy and worked very hard to build a supportive friend group around me that has pretty much negated those depressive states. It was purely circumstantial to a compound series of traumatic events.",,no,"maternal - bipolar/manic depressive disorder (diagnosed), signs of ADHD (not-diagnosed)
paternal - signs of autism/Aspergers (not-diagnosed)",n/a,"usually ahead of schedule. problem solving and attention to detail usually overtakes social understanding. I removed my own training wheels at the age of three without supervision because I had observed the use of a wrench and wanted to be like my older brother. On the flipside, I didn't like the feeling of tight jeans, so I wore sweat pants exclusively until the 5th grade.","no sports, but I run several online groups and have usually been a community builder throughout my life, often throwing myself deep in over my head in responsibilities. I really want to join more in-person groups, but I often have a hard time finding them or get discouraged during the search.",no,"I recently moved home during a job change because it coincided with a parent retiring and needing help to prepare to sell her home. My sister was going through her own traumatic life events and I had convinced her to move home years prior. 

It is not a ""safe"" place emotionally, but it's not particularly difficult to avoid challenging / triggering situations either. It is extremely ""safe"" in all other aspects.","Yes. previous question got to most of them. 

I have an estranged brother who was always struggling and eventually just left the family all together. My younger sister is struggling to deal with her past trauma and has tantrums and often can't maintain a job. Parents divorced later in life just 3-5 years ago and my mother is not handling it well. She recently retired and has no direction. 

I was dating someone for 5 years (3 years ago) who came out as gay, ultimately ending one of the best relationships either of us had been in. The emotional trauma made me very hesitant to trust any relationship.","not sure I understand this question","I am passionate, loyal, trustworthy, hardworking, patient, and caring. I am secure in who I am and recently learned that I am ""(K)enough"" (+10 if you get that reference)

I value honesty and integrity. I feel I am able to look at the broader situation/implications and accept that I may be the problem or that my view might require more consideration.","I get along with other ADHD people just fine actually. I do notice that I only get along well for a long-term friendship with about 1/10 people. There was a time when I would be much more of a social butterfly, but it was exhausting and I started to be more restrictive about who I let get closer to me. 

I DO have a hard time reaching out to people, even close friends, when I enter a low-confidence or low-motivation state",,1-2?,no,n/a,n/a,"I just want to get to a point where I can feel organized, mostly stay on topic, and be more productive so I can get back time in my day, and hopefully achieve my goals in life.

I don’t have a lot of friends, but those I have are very close and I’ve known them for several years now. 
I have difficulty connecting with my peers if they aren’t neurodivergent in some way, we just don’t seem to be operating on the same frequency, and as such all of my friends are neurodivergent in some way, and those were all very fast friends.

I do tend to avoid people when I am lacking confidence or being hard on myself. However, I am aware of it and am getting better at reaching out.","I have always had severe PMS and heightened anxiety. I will isolate if I am feeling irritable and moody. This tends to happen a week before menstruation for a few or more more days and always the day before.

My current therapist and psychiatrist have been the most helpful.","I have had many therapists over the past 20 years. My current therapist I have been working with for 4-5 yrs.","Yes I have been taking Prozac for almost 20 years. I was originally prescribed it to off-set the depression the progesterone birth control gave me. Even though I stopped taking the birth control, every time I tried to wean myself off of the prozac under a doctor’s guidance  I get severe mood swings and felt like I didn’t have control of my thoughts. Very scary. I currently take 20 mgs with no side effects when I took more I lost my sex drive. However this 20 mgs does nothing to help my anxiety, ocd or pms

I am also taking 150 mgs of wellbutrin with no side effects. This helps me a-lot. I have less anxiety and feel more stable emotionally outside of pms. However, when I took 300 mgs I had terrible night sweats. 

Birth control of all types makes me angry and irritable and wrestle with thoughts of suicide (outside of the depo provera shot I took that gave me bad depression)

I tried Zoloft and that was scary as well. I felt like I lost control of who I am and wanted to die.",,No.,,"I have herniated disks in my neck and advanced degenerative bone disease.

I spend my time caring and looking after him with all his activities and playdates. I am renovating a third house and in the middle of a divorce. As my life settles down I plan to get out in nature more. I love herbs/flowers arts, crafts and painting. Any community group I participate in includes my son.","Yes. I have seen a physical therapist a few times for various issues.","Currently I live with my nine year old son and husband Jim whom I will soon be getting a divorce with. It is difficult but we are both doing our best for our son. We can’t split up until we sell our house.","We will be moving into separate house by the end of the summer.

I can’t afford to pay out of pocket to get updated testing. I have only completed my first year into my associates degree. I am a very slow reader and switch up words and letters and numbers all the time. I also get tongue tied and have difficulty pronouncing words sometimes. I can’t do math in my head to save my life.","I get headaches quite a bit. But otherwise considering my terrible child hood and emotionally unstable marriage I think I am doing pretty well. I am mainly interested in taking this test to have something on paper to show the college hoping they will give me extra exam/study time and to make sure my brain is working all right.

occupational or relational impairment","In general, I would like to better understand some of my behavior traits, especially in relation to social issues and focus at work.  I moved around a lot when I was younger, and I do not have many close associations.  People sometimes find me a bit arrogant and aloof, when in fact I just find socializing (esp professionally) to be hard work.  I also do suffer some from focus issues esp in the mornings, and putting things off even when I know its better to do them first thing in the morning.",No,"Poor social skills, I can do it but it takes a lot of work.  I sometimes find it better to avoid those situations than to pretend my way through them.  When in discussions, I tend to be 0% or 100%... either I'm totally passive or dominating the conversation.  Even I find that annoying.

I definitely also get extremely frustrated by small simple things that I know aren't really a big deal but can drive me crazy.  I definitely suspect I have some OCD about certain things.  Conversely, in an actual crisis I tend to be calm and clear headed.","No that I know of, though I know I ended up in the hospital when I was a kid when a roof tile fell on my head.",,"At home I have to fall asleep later (between midnight and 1am), otherwise I take forever to fall asleep and tend to wake up in the middle of the night.","Tried most of those things, nothing in particular has made a huge difference.  Some professional coaching has been useful but it doesn't change the fact that social situations are a lot of work.","Just started lately, they recommended I try this.",No,,"Not really",,No,"Depression, and I suspect OCD",,Yes,"Surfing, bike riding, etc.","Some, nothing very recently.","I live with my wife.","We moved a few years ago to San Diego from San Francisco, nothing otherwise.","Born in Poland, grew up in Australia, then Chicago, now California.  My family is pretty scattered, grandmother lived mostly in the US, uncle/aunt/cousins in Zimbabwe, so rarely had extended family around.","Good at reasoning through complex problems and distilling them down to actionable things, often see patterns others don't, often predict when a company I'm working at is about to go downhill (many often tell me I ""left at the right time"").  I do actually care about others and want them to be happy, I just don't think its generally my problem to make that happen.","I prefer to have a few close friends, but for me socializing (and hugs for that matter) great in theory, but often annoying in practice.

occupational or relational impairment","I have always struggled with what I assumed to be social anxiety and relationships, but now I am wondering if it is something more than that. Such as a social impairment.

I also am a huge procrastinator and sometimes lack motivation. I always get things done, but it is at the last minute and the ability to decide when I do it feels out of my control.

I am super sensitive and almost overly in-tune and aware of other people’s emotions. 

I am starting to realize that I sometimes take things more literally than they need to be taken.

I have a sensory sensitivity to sounds, mostly loud noises.

Change is a big issue for me, even small things such as a change in a daily schedule or plan. 

I have a hard time parting with things, mostly material belongings.

I need things to be just right. Everything in its place that I have designated or in a certain order.

I easily get hyper fixated on certain things such as movies, shows, celebrities, etc.

I can occasionally be impulsive with my actions. Such as randomly doing something out of my comfort zone that may surprise those around me.","My younger brother was diagnosed with cancer when I was five years old. He fought it for five years, so I spent that time in and out of the hospital with him and my parents. He passed away when I was ten years old.
I do not get nightmares or consistent flashbacks and it has not caused me to have any avoidance in present day.","I spend most of my days in my room or with my parents, mostly my mom. I tend to isolate myself from social activities unless I feel completely comfortable or that I have a sense of control in the situation. I am hesitant when making friends or connections.

I have an irrational stress of major loss in my life, mostly loss of my parents. I’m sure this stems from the loss of my brother.

When I get overly stressed or overstimulated I either have a meltdown or shutdown.",No.,,"I sleep pretty well. I do however need it to be almost completely silent for me to fall asleep. Even the slight sound of a fan can throw me off.","I have tried therapy and that was very helpful for me to work through a lot, mostly regarding the loss of my brother.

Exercise is also helpful for me. I go in and out of consistency.","Yes, I worked with a therapist for about two and a half years. I have not been to therapy in just over a year.",No.,,No.,,"I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria as I identify as transgender/non-binary.

I have lost my temper a couple of times (only about two) when people disregard my feelings or push on my sensitivities.

I don’t necessarily have a lack of desire to initiate relationships, but my anxiety and lack of experience hinders me from doing so.",,"Around 4 hours. I usually jump between TikTok and Instagram.",No.,N/A,"I don’t have any concerns regarding my academics.

I know that I have complex PTSD and adhd. I would like testing to assess my depression since I am not 100% certain as to the source, and hopefully that can help in treating it?

I also have concerns that I may have some other things going on since I have had very powerful delusions in the past,","Yes. I was neglected and abused by my parents from around 15 till when I moved out at 18. This significantly affects my life. I struggle to trust others, I have regular nightmares, I avoid a lot in my daily life and have been over the course of several years improving. I used to be completely and utterly gripped by terror if I took a single step outside my apartment. And then I got to the point that I could go outside if I was with my partner (still scared, but more managable). And recently I went into a grocery store on my own for the first time in years.","I generally have poor social skills, I struggle with some paranoia, especially if I’m home alone. But it’s been more managable since I got my cats. I get paranoid that there’s someone in the house, but with the cats nearby, I feel assured by their presence and calm (when they ARE calm anyway). In the past, my depression has been so intense that I can’t get out of bed, I think I’ve had mood swings , but I’m not certain.","Yes, I had a head injury when I was 18. The hospital diagnosed me with a “minor concussion” and gave me one day off college classes. But I was not well. For the following threeish weeks, I had intense sensitivity to light and sound, and I would wake up, go to my one college class with required attendance, and then sleep. I wasn’t in a place to advocate for myself medically, and I didn’t trust my parents to help me, so I didn’t seek further medical attention until at least a year later. Once I had recovered from my injury sufficiently enough to be able to walk arouns a do things, I was different.

Prior to my injury, I was very high energy, and then after I was not and in fact have dealt with constant fatigue since then. Prior to my injury I was very gregarious and confident and outgoing, and then I was not. It was after the injury that I had the agoraphobia and more severe anxiety and distrust of others. And suddenly I had a hair trigger temper, and when I would get triggered, I would become violent because I just couldn’t control myself","Emotional over eating","I find it hard to get to sleep because I worry and get overwhelmed by them. I’m Constantly fatigued, but despite that I’ll find it difficult to get to sleep.","I attended a partial hospitalization program, and I found that very helpful. 
I found the dialectical Behavioral Therapy I learned there to be very effective, also a self help book about mindfulness . I also did EMDR(?) therapy and I found that to be very effective, but I didn’t vibe with the therapist that did it.","I have had therapists in the past, I’ve had my current therapist since January","Yes. I took Effexor, amd I found it was very effective for a while, but then it stopped working and it gave me really bad headaches and nausea.",,"None currently, but I did make passive attempts two times, and was sectioned and held for less than a day both times. I was 18 one time and I think around 16 the other time. These symptoms are currently managed with medication and therapy.

When I’ve had meltdowns(?) (honestly not sure what exactly to call it) but when I’ve had mental breaks, I’ve hurt myself, tried to hurt myself, hit myself, hit others, put myself in dangerous situations, made ineffective attempts to kill myself (I tried to strangle myself by hand because I was overwhelmed and i thought it was the only way to calm down) 

My partner isn’t really capable of handling me, much less her own reactions, when I have events like that. So I just try to avoid any and all potentially triggering situations.",,"I have been diagnosed with adhd, ptsd, and anxiety and depression.
I am currently taking wellbutrin, clonodine, abilify, adderall, and one other who’s name currently escapes me.","My mother’s side of the family is very anti-medicine and so I’m not sure, and on my father’s side they just don’t talk about things like that. I know my sister struggled with anxiety and depression, and my maternal grandmother also struggles with anxiety",N/a,"I know my parents said they were considering holding me back a grade because I wasn’t socially developing right. I also know I didn’t talk until I was sround 4.","I have many solo hobbies, painting, bird watching, drawing, sewing, baking. But I would like to be more involved in community/group activites/sports/whatever.","I don’t think so","Currently I live with my platonic spouse and her parents in her parent’s’ house",No,"My family of origin is VERY religious, to an extreme degree. I did not get medical treatment for injuries I sustained because my parents wanted to “pray” instead. They did not keep any pain medication in the house because they believed that if you took medicine, it meant that you “didn’t believe jesus could heal you”

I probably would have been diagnosed with autism long ago if they were less of extremists.","I would say one of my best qualities is my creativity and ability to make new things and find new perspectives and ideas. I would say my best strength is my commitment to improvement. I’ve struggled with a lot, with the abuse, and mental illnesses, and loneliness, and financial issues, and fear and anxiety.
But I keep going, and I’ve made progress. It’s slow and takes time, but I’ve done it, and I’m committed to continuing to improve for the rest of my life.","Yes. I have struggled to make or maintain relationships my entire life. I struggle with social things, and I feel like I cant connect with other people. I describe it as a glass box. I can see people outside the box, connecting with one another, but I’m seperate. Different. And when I try to connect, I just can’t.",,"I usually browse youtube, according to my phone it’s youtube, reddit, and tumblr, in that order, for about an hour each","No, none",N/a,"I have a high school diploma, I have completed some college, and I want to go back to college.","I struggle a lot with executive functioning. I would like to get a service dog, to help me when I’m triggered/have a mental break/meltdown, because I don’t have anyone in my life who can help me when they’ve been bad, and I can’t guarantee I’ll never have a bad time again. It’s a source of constant anxiety and I stay on high guard whenever I’m out because if I have a mental break outside of home, then it could be really bad. And they’re always the worst when I get triggered when my guard is down and I’m relaxed. 

I’m hoping that I’ll be able to get access to more help through this.",https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5916222887901780754/5916222887901780754_signature_58.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5916222887901780754/5916222887901780754_signature_62.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5916222887901780754/5916222887901780754_signature_61.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5916222887901780754/5916222887901780754_signature_60.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5916222887901780754/5916222887901780754_signature_59.png,,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5916222887901780754/5916222887901780754_signature_54.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5916222887901780754/5916222887901780754_base64_75_1715813089.png,https://www.jotform.com/uploads/Long_Colleen_drcolleen/241076699251160/5916222887901780754/5916222887901780754_base64_76_1715813090.png,,,,,,,,,,"Consent to Send: I consent for Clarity Psychological Testing to send assessments, input forms, and other relevant documents to the therapists, teachers, and allied health professionals I designate:

I used to live with my husband but due to him getting hit with some health stuff suddenly, we moved out of our apartment and into his parents house(mom dad brorher). I lived there until it was too stressful and moved in with my roommate John. John is nice but when he's stressed out and something goes wrong he has a bit of a melt down. I'm not home much and respect each other's space so when things like that happen, they pass quickly and I don't worry much about it. He has 2 cats that I love very much, but one cat (Molly) has a bad habit of yelling at night. John gets seriously upset bc he feels like she does it on purpose and says he hates her when he's mad and is stumped about what to do. But really he could put earplugs in but he says no bc if something actually happened to the cats and he didn't hear it he wouldn't forgive himself. So in short, he stresses a lot over things that I think have a simple solution and I think he can overreact sometimes, but ultimately he's a good person and easy to live with because I'm usually working away from the house.","Well, changing homes twice in the last 4 years and living without my husband sucks. Our relationship is solid i love him so much, which makes the situation suck more because I only ever want to come home to him. He's been going through some health issues and we've seen a lot of doctors that have dismissed him because he's ""too young"" (32years now) or ""it's anxiety"" (he is high strung but not to the point of giving him heart palpitations which we got figured out from a cardiologist in Murieta).
We got married in 2021 and a week later I got a call from my Dad about my mom's health decline after I'd stopped talking to all immediate family for about 2 years. She was hospice bound bc of psoriasis of the liver, I went and tried to mend a piece of my relationship with her before the end but she ruined it and haven't reached out to her since. After an emergency surgery, my dad took care of her even though ll the doctors said she was going to die soon, and 3 years later she's still alive. I love my mom but I don't love the alcoholic or the person that pushed me and my brothers away and wrote letters to us from her death bed pointing fingers. I'm still in the cycle of grief over her and have come to terms from therapy that it's okay for me to want to to pass on so I can finish that cycle. And if I'm honest  so I don't have to think about how much physical and emotional pain she's still in everyday. Soooo, lots of major changes in 4 years that keep following me around. Maybe I lost a bet in a previous life or something and now I live the life as a Soap Opera character- at least with how much drama that's in my life I wouldn't be too suprised.","Both my parents had alcoholic fathers who were emotionally and physically abusive. Both parents have history of substance abuse, crack and coke in the 80s, Dad is a super pothead. Mom can't physically drink alcohol any more of it would insta-kill her from what I've heard.","I never give up (for long)

Because I don't engage in this type of substance use, nor does my spouse, these experiences happen rarely- only really when I'm at a music festival (2x year) or happen to see something like a party goer our in the city, or unhoused individual appear under the influence.

In my adult life as indicated above, I've been working through trauma treatment to target symptoms I believed were possible Major depression or C-PTSD- these include isolation, lack of motivation, couldn't get out of bed, inattentiveness, forgetfulness, interrupting others- finishing sentences, distress when felt unheard,, irritability, confusion with social settings- being awkward and talking about myself/preferred things, hard time making friends, and rigidity. 
After lots of work with trauma reprocessing, I did feel much better - lighter- but many of these symptoms persisted. In fall 2023 I sought medication again for (formally) ADD, now ADHD. Many of the symptoms are managed well with medication- except - distress when felt unheard,, irritability, confusion with social settings- being awkward and talking about myself/preferred things, hard time making friends, and rigidity. I'm wondering if these symptoms are actually ASD and I've been misdx my whole life. I took an online AQ10 and scored high enough that the results were ""You may benefit from some more specialized assessments of ASD"" so here I am! 
I also recently connected that I have always cracked my knuckles and/or am constantly fidgeting with a ring on my thumb- and these could actually be forms of stimming- I thought they were just pervasive habits",Nope,,"Sleeping is okay for me. I used to require on average 12 hours per night before medication for ADHD. With this medication I am able to get 8 hours consistently and feel more rested than before.","Extensive therapies targeted towards behavior/trauma. 

Given that what has worked the best, and fastest, has been medication for ADHD and Executive function support- I'm interested to explore ASD.","Literally forever lol . I had a few years between 17-19 when I didn't see someone, both otherwise I've been in therapy.","I tried Prozac and Wellburtin before I explored ADHD symptoms more. Prozac was terrible and made me a zombie. Wellbutrin was helpful though I started feeling nausea so we stopped it. 

A few months later I went to explore ADHD medication based on the success of Wellburtin, and it has been seriously life changing.",,"No , No symptoms at all.",,"I am overweight, and have been my whole life. It appears to be genetic- I began Wegovy in Jan 2021, lost 70 pounds between Jan 21- Aug 23. I then switched and am I'm currently on Zepbound 15ml injection. and have since lost another 20 pounds. I am near my goal weight, which I will then transition to lower doses.","Mom dx with bipolar and I recall significant SI at times. 

Dad was never formally dx but extensive SUD (he died ultimately due to complication of alcohol). Again, he was never formally dx, but I absolutely believe he had C-PTSD, conduct/opposition, and ultimately NPD.",N/a,"I recall early intervention and having to use a special pencil holder for my hand- but that's all.","I enjoy houseplants and reading- i want to be more social and it's a goal of mine.

occupational or relational impairment","I've been at my job for a long time and should almost always know exactly what I'm doing, but I'm incredibly forgetful. I'll write stuff down and forget to look at what I've written. I've broken rules I forgot were rules. My brain feels like a snow globe. I often can't keep track of what people are talking about in meetings - my mind wanders quickly and often. I have to write everything down or I will forget it - and even when I do write it down, it's often on a scrap of paper that I lose or never look at again. I've started to think I just can't do my job anymore, cognitively - like I'm just not cut out for it. But I have a good 25 years of work left!  

I lose everything all the time. I have air tags on my wallet, purse, and keys. I ping my keys at least 4 times a day and my phone 5-10 times a day (I work from home in a 900 sq ft apartment - it's not like there are a lot of places this stuff could be.) I have a key hook right by my door - I cannot remember to put my keys on the hook. I procrastinate with EVERYTHING. I have always been like this - I never did any homework or school assignments until the very last minute. I need the adrenaline to get me through. 

I've tried apps, I update my google calendar using time blocking, but ignore the notifications when it reminds me to do stuff. I wind up saving everything until the end of the week and scramble to finish. I just have zero motivation to do anything, unless it's something I'm super interested in and excited about. I could go on and on...","Nothing too dramatic. My dad was an alcoholic and there was a lot of yelling, but usually not at me. Never any physical violence.","I am so irritable all the time. I'm so easily frustrated. I have no patience for my kids or my job or even my friends. I strongly prefer to be alone where no one needs anything from me so I can't screw anything up. I definitely isolate myself when I'm struggling with depression.",No.,"Emotional over eating","My sleep has been rough lately. I've been waking up at like 2:30am ready for the day. Last night I went to bed exhausted and could not fall asleep until 3am when I took an Advil PM. My psychiatrist just prescribed Trazodone to see if it will help. I haven't filled the Rx yet - because I procrastinate on literally everything.","I consume a lot of self help material. I've also tried L-Theanine plus caffeine and that actually seemed to be working for awhile to help me focus but it's lost its efficacy. Might've been a placebo effect. I've been in therapy for about 5 years and now also see a psychiatrist. I try to focus on my breathing when I feel over-stimulated or overwhelmed. It sometimes works. I've tried mediating but I seem to be unable to sit with myself for any length of time.","Currently on my second therapist. And I started working with a psychiatric NP about 2 years ago.","I'm currently on prozac and wellbutrin. My NP just lowered my wellbutrin dose in an attempt to curb my persistent irritability. I feel like the only time I'm not irritable is if I'm completely by myself.",,"Not severe, no.",,"I have controlled hypertension. I also take medicine for hypothyroidism.","Yes - my paternal grandfather committed suicide.","I had pre-eclampsia.","Yes, all on time.","I play in an adult softball league but haven't been able to play this season because of some issues with my joints.","Physical therapist, yes - for tennis/golfer's elbow, rotator cuff injury, hip issues, and now SI joint issues.","I live in an apartment with two of my four kids.

She's the 13 year old.","I'm very empathetic, I can see multiple sides to every story. I love to learn - I'm very curious about random things that interest me. I'm relatively smart, but I do find my brain doesn't work at logic as well as I want it to. Sometimes I have a really hard time just keeping up with whatever topic is being discussed.","I had an affair, which led to my divorce. I constantly had crushes during my marriage. I was never satisfied, even though my wife was a lovely, beautiful person.",,"About 2 hours - mostly instagram.",No.,,"I got my masters degree in English. I wrote a lot of papers last minute.
